"Abu Simbel, Egypt",Rock cut Temple,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/egyptabusimbel.htm,"Abu Simbel, Egypt"," The 'Great Temple' at Abu Simbel, was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great (which corresponds to 1265 BCE). It was dedicated to the gods Amun, Ra-Horakhty, and Ptah, as well as to the deified Ramesses himself(2).The temple of Hathor and Nefertari, also known as the Small Temple, was built about one hundred meters northeast of the temple of Ramesses II and was dedicated to the goddess Hathor and Ramesses II's chief consort, Nefertari. The salvage of the Abu Simbel temples began in 1964, and cost some USD $40 million. Between 1964 and 1968, the entire site was cut into large blocks (up to 30 tons averaging 20 tons), dismantled and reassembled in a new location ï¿½ 65 m higher and 200 m back from the river, in what many consider one of the greatest feats of archaeological engineering. Some structures were even saved from under the waters of Lake Nasser. Today, thousands of tourists visit the temples daily. Guarded convoys of buses and cars depart twice a day from Aswan, the nearest city. Many visitors also arrive by plane, at an airfield that was specially constructed for the temple complex.  The axis of the temple was positioned by the ancient Egyptian architects in such a way that twice a year, onOctober 20andFebruary 20, the rays of the sun would penetrate the sanctuary and illuminate the sculpture on the back wall, except for the statue of Ptah, the god connected with the Underworld, who always remained in the dark.(2)These dates are allegedly the king's birthday and coronation day respectively, but there is no evidence to support this, though it is quite logical to assume that these dates had some relation to a great event, such as the jubilee celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the pharaoh's rule. In fact, according to calculations made on the basis of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Sothis) and inscriptions found by archaeologists, this date must have been October 22. This image of the king was enhanced and revitalized by the energy of the solar star, and the deified Rameses Great could take his place next to Amun Ra and Ra-Horakhty. ""I was fortunate in seeing another wonderful thing during my visit to Abu Simbel... on two days of the year the sun is said to rise at such a point that it sends a beam of light through both halls till it falls on the shrine itself in the very holy of holies....It was on the 26th February. The great hall, with its eight Osiride pillars was wrapped in semi-darkness. Still darker were the inner hall and shrine. Behind the altar sat the four gods, Amen, Horus, Ptah and Rameses himself, now deified. All the east was a deep rosy flush; then that paled, and a hard white light filled the sky. Clearer and whiter it grew, till, with a sudden joyous rush, the sun swung up over the low ridge of hill, and in an instant, like an arrow from the bow of Phoebus Apollo, one level shaft of light pierced the great hall and fell in living glory straight upon the shrine itself"".(1)  ","(22.3460086, 31.6156242)",22.3460086,31.6156242,"The 'Great Temple' at Abu Simbel, was completed around year 24 of the reign of Ramesses the Great (which corresponds to 1265 BCE).

"Abydoss, Egypt",Temple Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/egyptabydoss.htm,Abydoss: The Osireion,"Abydoss has revealed itself to be one of the most important   archaeological sites in Egypt. It is the site of the pre-dynastic   royal graveyard, which has revealed some interesting links with Sumeria; and of the Osireion, an enigmatic underground chamber   connected to the Nile, fashioned from enormous blocksthe style of which is comparable only with that seen at the Valley temple, Giza. The temple of the Sixth Dynasty Seti I was later built over this site, which assuredly dates from an earlier time. Seti I, the second king of the 19th Dynasty was the son of Ramesses I and Queen Sitre. He reconciled with the Hittites who were becoming the most powerful state in the region. Seti I and his heir, Ramesses II campaigned against Kadesh. In Karnak he completed his father's plan by converting the court between the second and third pylons into a vast hypostyle hall. He built his vast mortuary complex at Abydos. Seti-I was enedtomb in the Valley of the Kings where he was finally entombed was vandalized and his body was relocated to Deir el Bahri. The mummy of Seti I was found at Dayru l-Bahri in 1881. These engravings have aroused much attention in the past... Their apparent similarity to modern vehicles is impelling,  but it has been suggested that they are the product oftwosets of hieroglyphs, one over the other... and however unusual that may be, the idea seems borne out by looking further along the beam... The water in the temple is an indication of the level of the Nile approx' 6.5 miles away. It measures approximately 20 x 30m, is 50ft lower and is made of a clearly different construction style to that of the temple of Seti I (Sixth Dynasty) above. The water level insde the temple is attached to the water table. As Seti-I began the search for a location for his Temple, he  was lead to a location north of Luxor in the bend of the River Nile. There he began to dig the foundation for his Temple. What he discovered was the Osireion, or the ancient temple of Osiris. Whether he actually knew that the Osireion was there, perhaps we will never know, but upon finding this ancient temple in the path of his new temple, he turned his new temple to the left. It is the only temple in Egypt that makes an 'L' turn.  The area is constructed of blocks up to 25 ft long. Almost flush with the water table and therefore the Nile, it is likely it was always part filled with water, leaving a central plinth protruding like an island in the centre. The walls surrounding the building are 20 ft thick, red sandstone. The chamber is surrounded by a ï¿½moatï¿½ with ï¿½cellsï¿½ coming off it, six to the east, six to the west, two to the south and three to the north. The whole structure was enclosed within an outer wall of limestone. This structure shows significant architectural differences to the temple above and is believed to be far older. It shows several similarities to the ï¿½Valley Templeï¿½ at Ghiza(21), which is also recognised as an early-dynasty structure. In relation to this issue, it is perhaps significant that the temple Osireion is dedicated to Osiris, while the 'Valley temple' at Giza is associated to Isis. (More on this below). 'There is no longer any doubt, then, that we have discovered what Strabo calls  the well or the fountain of Abydos. He spoke of it as being near the temple, at a great depth, and remarkable for some corridors whose ceilings were formed of enormous monolithic blocks. That is exactly what we have found. These cells were 17 in number, 6 on each of the long side. There was one in the middle of the wall at the back; in passing through it one came in the rear to the large hall which was the tomb of Osiris. A careful study of the sculptures confirmed the opinion that this was a funeral hall where the remains of the god were expected to be found. but this hall did not form part of the original edifice. It must have been constructed underground when Seti I built the temple of the god. The tomb of Osiris was very near the great reservoir. Nothing revealed its presence; the entrance to it was exactly like that to all the other cells, the back of it being walled up after they had dug through it... ...We have as yet no certain indications of the date of the construction; but the style, the size of the materials, the complete absence of all ornamentation, all indicate very great antiquity. Up to present time what is called the temple of the Sphinx at Gizeh has always been considered one of the most ancient edifices of Egypt. It is contemporaneous with the pyramid of Chefren... The layer of water in the Osireion is reminiscent of the 'Holy wells' or 'Well shrines' of pagan Britain which were noted for their healing properties, and in many cases were popular places of pilgrimage. The picture (left), is an old print of St. Triduana's reliquary chapel (well-shrine) in Edinburgh(1). Sir N. Lockyer says this on the subject: 'The orientations given by different authors are so conflicting that no certainty can be claimed, but it is possible that at Abydoss one of the mounds is not far from the amplitude shown in the tables for the sun in the Nile valley at sunset at eh summer-solstice'   It has been suggested that the Osireion and the Valley temple at Giza are contemporary structures. There are several factors which indicate that this may be the case, which would make the Osireion a 4th dynasty structure. We know that the temple of Seti I was built in the 6th Dynasty(4th Dynasty (2,613ï¿½2,498 BC),  6th Dynasty (2345ï¿½2181 BC) (7)).only a matter of a hundred years later, and in a completely different style of architecture. It is worth exploring the idea that the Osireion and the Valley temple might at least share a common theme in construction. Both structures were made from   large, unadorned and lintelled pillars. Two rows running along the length with five pillars in   each, creating a central chamber. Both structures were covered   over, and both were associated with the Nile. The Osireion has 17 chambers running along the walls while the Valley Temple has 17 sockets in the floor for statues. Naville, who excavated the site in 1913-14, immediately recognised the similarities between Khafre's Valley Temple at Giza and the Osireion, and concluded that they were of the same Old Kingdom era.  The Osireion is     associated with Osiris, and the Valley temple to Isis, his     consort and sister, as demonstrated by the Inventory Stela, discovered by Auguste Mariette in the 1850's. It reads as follows:  The association with Isis on this stela (whether from the 4th of 12th dynasty) is of particular interest as it appears to confirm the early-dynastic history of the unification of 'upper' and 'lower' Egypt and the primal Egyptian myth of Osiris and Isis, in relation to these temples. These temples suggest a commonality, whilst adhering to the theme of the Isis/Osiris myths. The Osireion is associated with Osiris, and the Valley temple to Isis, his consort, sister and mother. The Ghiza pyramids are cardinally orientated (equinoxially), while the great temples in the south of Egypt such as Karnack, Denderra and The Temple of Seti (Osireion), are orientated to the solstices. The symbolic act of unification, was not only concerned with the physical boundaries of  Egypt,  but also the solar year.  This round-topped stellae (right), of King Djet, the 4thKing of the 1st Dynasty was probably originally erected on the east side of his royal mastaba tomb. It was found in a royal necropolis at Abdyoss, where most kings of the 1st Dynasty were buried. It was created of limestone, a relatively soft stone.The Horus falcon perches on top of the rectangular serekh, which contains the hieroglyph of a cobra, the actual name of the king.  (Uadji? Djet?)  Article: Hieroglyphs Dated Back to 3,200 BC at Abydoss: Recent discoveries   at the site of Abydoss have demonstrated that Egyptian hieroglyphs   date back at least to the 32nd century BC. Notably older than earlier   estimates, these discoveries give Egypt pride of place for the oldest   known system of writing. They have also forced a revision of some   assumptions about the development of Egyptian hieroglyphs. The   existence of ideograms alongside phonetic symbols led linguists to the   conclusion that hieroglyphs began as a rudimentary series of   ideographic characters, where one sign meant one thing, independently   of the spoken word; and that the system gradually developed a phonetic   component as greater sophistication was needed. The discoveries at   Abydoss seem to contradict this model. At issue are small   tags, perforated with a hole in one corner, bearing one or more   primitive carvings similar to classic hieroglyphs. Some of these   carvings are more obviously similar to known hieroglyphs than others,   and the archaeologists dealing with them found that if these carvings   were read like standard Egyptian writing, they not only made sense in   a generic fashion, but they actually clarified the nature of the   discovery: they were tied to goods that were brought to the tomb then   under excavation, and identified the nature of those goods. Thus,   Egyptian writing was already phonetic at that early date.  This ritual knife was discovered in the Royal cemetery at Abydoss. The inscriptions on it are reminiscent of Sumerian and Mesopotamian engravings. They appear to depict a battle on one side and the 'Gilgamesh' figure flanked by two lions on the other.

"Adam's Calendar, Africa",Stone Setting,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/africaadamscalendar.htm,"Adam's Calendar, Africa","Controversially suggested to be the oldest man-made site on earth by Michael Tellinger and Johan Heine.There are two distinct sets of remains in question:The 'Bantu Kraals'...and'Adams Calendar'. Tellinger claims that both the ruins and 'calendar' stones were inspired by the Sumerian Anunaki, and that they date from 260,000 years ago. He has also suggested that these are the remains of Enki's lost mythological Sumerian city of Abzu (Hell), where he believes the first humans were used as slaves to mine for gold. He also states that Great Zimbabwe was Enki's 'Headquarters', simultaneously dating it to c. 260,000 years old.(3)  When historians first stumbled upon these structures they assumed that they were cattle kraal left behind by the Bantu people as they moved south and settled the land from around the 13th century. This idea today seems unlikely as a definitive answer, as there are several thousand similar ruins spread over tens of thousands of miles. The design of the structures is unlike any other Bantu cattle-kraal designs, which are usually made of thorny shrubs, with a single entrance/exit for the cattle. The complexity, design and high number, offer the possibility that these are the remains of a lost 'cultural activity' hitherto unaccounted for in the region. Tellinger said of the ruins:'Our research has shown that the ancient ruins of South Africa and Zimbabwe go back to around 260,000 years the very first appearance of humans on Earth'.(3)This is an unsubstantiated statement, with no evidence to support it. Without more accurate evidence however, we are left with the suggestion that the remains are from the 13th century. However, as we can see from the photo above, there is little, if any similarity to the Bantu kraal (below). The first estimates of the number of stone ruins was made in 1891 by Theodore Bent who had a real fascination with the stone ruins. He was also the first person to document his excavations of Great Zimbabwe at the time and estimated that there were about 4,000 stone ruins in this part of the world. This estimate has now been raised to around 20,000 ruins. Apart from such glimpses into history, as well as well-made iron and stone artefacts that were collected, little is known about the archaeology of the mountain-lands. From July 1952 to 1955 some 1915 artefacts were collected from 20 sites around Barberton, including the mountain lands. These are at present housed in the Barberton museum. The artefacts were collected from open donga sites where material of all ages was mixed on the surface. Earlier Stone Age (approximately 1 million to 200 000 years ago) implements were exposed at various depths in the deep dongas, Middle Stone Age (125 000 to 75 000 years) material occurred in the ferricrete overlying the subsoil, and Later Stone Age (between 30 000 and 40 000 years ago until about 2 000 years ago) artefacts were exposed by surface erosion. Even today many Late Stone Age artefacts are encountered on walks in the highlands.(4) However, the remains of ancient cultures that must once have thrived in the area are numerous. Terraces and rock packed structures can be found in the mountain-lands and research by Dr. Cyril Hromnik has it that the Dravidian merchant caste of southern India mined gold here 2000 years ago, resulting in these stone structures, celestial calendars as well as temples. Since 1984 interest in the early history of the Barberton goldfields has been revived by Dr. Hromnikï¿½s controversial research and his discovery in this area, of what he claims to be ancient megalithic Dravidian religious structures. Hromnik is of the opinion that an area known, as Komati-land was the trading zone of the Dravidians and that their presence in fact predates the appearance of the first Bantu in this part of Africa by centuries. The oral tradition of the local Swazi (Siswati), who settled in this area only relatively recently, in the first half of the 19th century, has little to say about these early gold miners. However the Swazi people are almost unanimous in attributing the stone enclosures, stonewalled roads and other stone structures that occur in the vicinity of the gold workings to the beSutfu. By calling these ancient stone-builders beSutfu the Swazi traditions do not refer, as is popularly believed, to the modern Bantu-speaking BaSotho (meaning ï¿½Black Peopleï¿½). ï¿½Sutfu is not just a Nguni variant of the name Sotho; the reference is, rather, to people of the uSutu River.(4) It has been noted that the area is extremely rich in gold. Several mining shafts have been reported in the area. Not only did the rich gold reefs attract attention in the 1880ï¿½s, but the early evidence of historic civilizations mining for minerals were described in writings by the early Europeans. Firstly, the prospectors found that others before them exploited gold by primitive methods. As D. Wilson (1901) Mining Commissioner and Landdrost of Kaapsche Hoop (then called Duiwels Kantoor), reported: ï¿½Another curious and puzzling find, affording evidence of a very high degree of civilization on the part of the ancient explorers of De Kaap, took place within a few yards of my office at the Kantoor. Running into the side of a steep hill, was the remains of a tunnel, which was opened up in the course of prospecting work, when the diggers unearthed two earthenware pipes about three feet long and six inches in diameter. They had most of the signs one looks for in ancient pottery and were obviously of very great ageï¿½. Who the ancient miners were, still remains an unresolved and tantalizing secret, and depending on oneï¿½s viewpoint, great efforts are made to attribute it to San people, Dravidian merchants form the Indian sub-continent, Arabs, Phoenicians and even Egyptians. Evidence of dwellings estimated to be some 500 years old can be interpreted as part of a culture that traded gold with eastern (Arabic and Indian) communities in the past. At least one such complete Iron Age ï¿½villageï¿½ is found on mountain-lands as well as various other sites still to be verified.(4)  Great Zimbabwe is a ruined city that was once the capital of theKingdom of Zimbabwe, which existed from around 1100 to 1450. The word ""Great"" distinguishes the site from the many hundreds of small ruins, known as Zimbabwe's, spread across the Zimbabwe highveld. The Capital of the Zimbabwe kingdom lies approximately 500 miles north of the site known as Adam's Calendar (below). Archaeological evidence suggests that Great Zimbabwe became a centre for trading, with artefacts suggesting that the city formed part of a trade network extending as far as China. This international trade was mainly in gold and ivory; some estimates indicate that more than 20 million ounces of gold were extracted from the ground.(5)It is in this very same region that one finds 'scattered throughout the strata and rocks ... deposits of reef and alluvial gold, and also iron, talc, asbestos and nickel'(4), offering a reasonable explanation for such a high concentration of ancient structures.  The stone setting now called 'Adam's Calendar' was first brought to the publics attention in 2003 by pilot Johan Heine. The stones are arranged on the precipice of the Transvaal Escarpment overlooking the Waterval Boven Valley. The stones are all dolomite, weighing up to 5-tons each, and are claimed to have been transported from a distance to the site as the Escarpment itself is composed of Black Reef Quartzite, rich in gold.(9)It is claimed that the stones would have originally stood in a circle, and that the remaining stones denote the cardinal points (off by 3ï¿½) and the rising/setting points of the solstice sun. In the centre of the 'circle' are two upright stones which are said to have been carved. It is claimed that the monolithic stones were transported from two miles away. This is apparently based on a geology report that indicates the rocks were moved here and worked with human hands.(8)The following two references to  the region both make reference to Dolomite being common. 'Aloe alooides (Bolus) .... Large single-stemmed aloe, 1-3 m: on rocky dolomite slopes in grassland and bushy thickets... Distribution: endemic to Mpumalanga, occurring sporadically on dolomite between Sudwala Caves and Blyde River Canyon N.R'.(6) 'Bird watchers should not miss out on an opportunity to see Chrissiesmeer, which is the largest natural freshwater lake in South Africa, and famous for flamingos. The Sudwala Caves deep in the dolomite rocks of the surrounding mountains, are worth visiting'(7) 'The first rough calculation was from at least 25,000 years ago. But new and more precise measurements kept increasing the age'... The next calculation was presented by a 'master archaeoastronomer' (Bill Hollenbach?(8)) who unsurprisingly, wishes to remain anonymous for 'fear of ridicule by the academic fraternity'. The calculation was apparently based on the rise of Orion and suggested an age of at least 75,000 years.(2) A further calculation in June 2009, suggested an age of at least 160,000 years, based on the rise of Orion 'flat on the horizon' but also on the 'erosion of dolerite stones' found at the site. Some pieces of the marker stones had been broken off and sat on the ground, exposed to natural erosion. When the pieces were put back together about 3 cm of stone had already been worn away. These calculation helped assess the age of the site by calculating the erosion rate of the dolerite.(2) 'Our research has shown that the ancient ruins of South Africa and Zimbabwe go back to around 260,000 years the very first appearance of humans on Earth'.(3) While the following images certainly suggest a human provenance for the stones, there is no evidence to support Tellinger's claims that they are '75,000 years or older'.

"Arbor Low, England",Henge-Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandarborlow.htm,"Arbor Low, England","Physical Description-This Henge-Circle was built near an ancient track-way (The Penine Bridleway). It is similar in design toStanton Drew,Avebury, Cairnpapple and the nearbyBull Ring.ThisNeolithic henge monument is composed of an earthen bank and ditch, a circle of some 50 white limestone slabs, all now fallen and surrounding a central stone 'cove' - a feature found only in major sacred sites.(1)Skeletal remains were found in the cove (With both hands and feet missing). The original bank would have once stood at around 3m high, and the limestone it was composed of would have shone a brilliant white. The  Limestone stones have now all collapsed, but one stone at the west is still slightly prostrate. Although the stones have the appearance of having been toppled, there are no post-holes present, which suggests that they may have never actually been erected. However, the antiquary Pegge recorded that in 1785 that a local man aged 60 remembered some of the stones still standing. In 1789, Pilkington recorded a similar account.(2) Analysis of the monuments position has shown that the ridge on which they lie occupies an ""important watershed position"", of significance in relation to the way in which this limestone landscape appears to have been occupied and used in prehistory (Barnatt and Collis 1996: 65).(2) While it is difficult to date the   monuments of Arbor Low and Gibb Hill with exact certainty, they are   proposed to be the result of cumulative episodes of use, which may have   continued from the Early to Mid Neolithic (c. 4,000 to 3,000 BC) into the   Early Bronze Age (c. 2,000 to 1,500 BC). Alignments- Arbor Low's avenue,    like that of Stonehenge was composed of earth. A single low bank curves away from the southern entrance, petering out in a field in the direction of Gibb Hill (a huge mound barrow to the south west), the two monuments were once attached by an earth ridge now called 'The Avenue'.  The significance of Arbor low is demonstrated in itsalignment withAveburyandStonehenge. Because we know that Stonehenge, Avebury and Glastonbury form a right angled triangle (accurate to within 1 part in a thousand) (click here for details), it means by inference that Arbor Low is also the northern most point of a large right angled triangle with Stonehenge and Glastonbury. The apparently deliberate   placement of significant prehistoric sites by exact degrees of both   longitude and latitude is something that is also commonly seen in   other ancient cultures such as the Ancient Greekoracles, several middle-eastern sacred sites, and in early   dynastic Egypt, all of which show high levels of Geodesy in the   placement of the most significant sites. The latitude of 53ï¿½ 10' is the   same angle as that produced by the 3:4:5 Pythagorean Triangle. It is   also coincidentally, the same as the exterior angle ofKhafre's Pyramidat Giza. This   same geodetic phenomena is repeated with The 'Great Pyramid and   Silbury Hill, both of which have exterior angles which reflect the   others latitude.

"Almendres, Portugal",Stone Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portocromleqdosalmendres.htm,Almendres: Cromeleque and Menhir," The orientation and association with other   nearby megaliths (i.e. Zambujeiro), combined with the   astronomical significance of the location itself demonstrate the   importance of astronomy to the builders. A part of the Evora complex in Portugal. This region is becoming known as 'The Iberian 'Mesopotamia'. The Almendres Cromlech   is believed to be one mankindï¿½s   first public monuments. It's the largest existing group of structured   menhirs in the Iberian Peninsula, and one of the largest in Europe. This   megalithic monument consisted originally of more than an hundred   monoliths, some of which over the ages were taken away for other uses. A   recent digging showed that there were several building phases during the   Neolithic period (5,000 - 4,000 BC.).  The latitude of the site may explain both the presence of such a grand stone circle, and of the high concentration of megaliths on the vicinity. (Now referred to as:The Iberian Mesopotamia). The Almendres Circles are also the terminal point for an alignment which runs across Portugal for over 50km, connecting at least three of the most significant sites in the country together. If one stands at Almendres on the spring full moon, it will rise on the horizon at approximately 110ï¿½ and travel directly towards you, passing first over the (now relocated)Xarez'quadrangle', then over the largest passage mound in Iberia (Zambujeiro), which is orientated along the same azimuth with its opening facing the rising moon. This very important   fact is one of the strongest pieces of evidence that the Neolithic   builders of this monument were aware of the natural rhythms of the sun   and moon. However, there is a secondary lunar association through the   fact that the Almendres circle is one end of a proposed 50km alignment   which follows the azimuth of the spring full-moon (110ï¿½).   The alignment continues eastward passing the  Zambujeiro   passage-mound, ending at theCromeleque da   Xarez, near Monsaraz making it the longest confirmed prehistoric alignment in Iberia. So while it is clearly possible todemonstrated a lunar significance at Almendres, it is interesting to note also that the circleis orientated towards - and has stones that face both the sunrise and sunset of the equinoxes, possibly due to the fact that Almendres is actually two circles. In addition, the Menhir do Almendres (see below) was erected just over a kilometre east, and is in line with the top of the circle at winter solstice so that when viewed from the cromlech, the menhir points to the sunrise in winter solstice, and vice-versa regarding the sunset (Although the distance and topography between the two sites make it unlikely that the two sites were ever inter-visible).  This Standing stone is approximately 1 km East from its neighbouring Circle theCromeleque Dos Almendres. It is described as 2.5m high, but actually stands at least 3m. It is reputed to have fallen twice in living memory; once during a cyclone in 1941 and again in 1964.

"Altamira, Spain",Magdalenian Cave-art,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/spainaltamira.htm,"Altamira, Spain","Particularly famous for being the first example of European Cave art ever discovered. The discovererMarcelino Sanz de Sautuola'sof the paintings in the cave in1879was sadly pilloried as a forger till his death fifteen years later. It wasn't until another five years after his death that another example of cave art was discovered which restored his reputation as an archaeologist. Description: There are three major sites containing cave paintings in Northern Spain which are presumed to have been painted by the Magdalenian people between 16,000-9,000 BC, but Altamira is the only site at which the signs of domestic life extend into the first cavern which contain the actual paintings.(1)The Altamira cave is one of seventeen found along the mountains of North Spain near the Atlantic coast. At around 300m long, the cave system consists of a series of twisting passages ranging from 2 - 6m high upon which over a hundred animal figures were drawn on the ceilings. In 2008 British scientists dated the paintings with the U/Th method. Before the carbon of the charcoal in the paintings was used to determine the age of the paintings using the C14 method. Obviously this works only for the black parts of the paintings which contain carbon. Uranium decays to thorium and this process happens in any kind of calcite deposit. This method measures the uranium and thorium content in flowstone crusts which grew on top of the painting. As a matter of fact this method only gives a minimum age, but it is usable also for engravings and paintings without charcoal. The results are astonishing: parts of the artworks are between 25,000 and 35,000 years old.(2) During the 1960s and 1970s, the paintings in the Altamira Cave were being damaged by the damp breath of large numbers of visitors. Altamira was completely closed to the public in 1977, and reopened to limited access in 1982. Very few visitors were allowed in per day, resulting in a three-year waiting list. At the present time, a study is being made of the conservation conditions inside the Cave of Altamira, so it is NOT possible to visit it. A museum and an unsatisfying, cheap replica of a small section of the cave were built nearby (You've been warned).  Artistic analysis:The paintings at Altamira are polychrome, having as many as three colours in the body of a single animal, a significant advance in technical artistic skills. The same artistic skills are further reflected in the accuracy of the physical proportions of depicted animals. One of the most impressive things about the animal figures are that many were painted on natural protrusions from the rock face; something seen in other caves from the Palaeolithic, although most samples of cave painting ignore the natural character of the rock concentrating on only one dimension. The images at Altamira were both painted and engraved.  In the complex of painting in the cave, bison's in different positions are most common and carried out most expertly. Other animals include horses, red deer and boar. The animal figures are painted to almost life-size scale, e.g. the red deer is 2.20m long. The artists very painstakingly depicted its specific and sexual features. The use of relief has given the  pictures a special dynamism and movement of the animals. Even the texture of the furs and manes of the different species painted on the rock surface were included.

"Arkaim, Russia","Complex, Settlement",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/russiaarkaim.htm,"Arkaim, Russia","The first official sighting of Arkaim was in 1935... 'Using information derived from military aerial photography, the geologist, Batenina, identified a number of these fortresses during the 1960s. A complex of 17 fortresses was discovered in the southern Urals in the region of Magnitogorsk, Troizk, and Orenburg. Excavations have been undertaken at the settlements of Sintashta,Arkaim, Ustje, Kujsak, and others'.(Genning et al 1992: fig. 1; Zdanovich 1995; Vinogradov 1995; Malutina et al 1995). The first research on the Prehistory of Arkaim came in the same year: Batenina, T. M. 1935.Distentsionnye metody pri-ercheologicheskichissledovaniyan v sapovednike Arkaim, pp. 105ï¿½6 inKultura drevnih narodov stepnoi Evrasii i fenomen protogorodskoi civilizacii yuzshnogo Urala1. Chelyabinsk (ï¿½Distant methods of archaeological investigations in the Arkaim.ï¿½ Culture of the ancient peoples of the Eurasian steppe and the phenomenon ofproto-city civilization).(5) In 1987, Arkaim valley in the Southern Urals was going to be flooded and turned into an artificial lake. But before that would happened archaeologists were given a year to find out about the mysterious circles. When archaeologists begun to work they found out that those circles were Arkaim's settlements! It was a sensation!  Arkaim is not only a settlement, but it is also a temple and an astronomic observatory! It was round and was 160 meters in diameter. It was surrounded by a ditch that was filled with water. An outside wall was very massive, the height was 5.5 meters and width was 5 meters. The wall had four gates. The largest gate was south-west gate. All the buildings were shaped in half rounds and were connected to the outside wall. Each building had exit to the main street in the city. Arkaim was built with four entrances to the city strictly oriented at cardinal points. It was built according to a previously designed plan, with a high level of precision. All circumferences have one centre where all radial feeders meet together.(3)The residential area of the fortress boasted advanced amenities considering the time it was built in. The pavement made of thick logs hid a sewage system. Two round one-storey houses positioned along the perimeter between the two fortified walls comprised separate apartments, a hundred or more square meters each. In addition to several rooms, each apartment had a hearth and a well. In the very centre of the city-fortress was a square where religious rites were performed.The first city, known as Arkaim, was rediscovered in 1989, soon after the soviet authorities allowed non-military aerial photography for the first time. The full extent of the remains is only now becoming apparent. Items that have so far been dug up include many pieces of pottery covered in swastikas, which were widely used ancient symbols of the sun and eternal life.(3) The shape of each of the cities, which are mainly in the Chelyabinsk district, are circular, divided into segments with a uniform street plan. The settlements, which would each have housed about 2000 people are all surrounded by a ditch and have a square in the middle.(3)Schematically we can see Mandala  - a square inside of a round. According to ancient scripts round is a symbol of Universe and square is a symbol of Earth Locals believe it to be a sacred place. Pilgrims come here all year round to get some healing water from the Bolshaya Karaganka River, and in the summer they coat themselves with clay. They say it helps treating skin diseases. The mountains surrounding the fortress are also unusual. The most famous one is Shamanka (or Bold Mountain). People climb to its top to get some positive energy, pray or meditate. People in serious medical condition are brought there for healing. Visitors come to the top of Repentance Mountain to ask for forgiveness. Love Mountain is believed to bring personal luck. The nearby Male Forest is visited by women who have relationship problems. The rumour has it, a walk in this forest will make a woman popular with men. The growth near Grachinaya Mountain (also called Blessed) is infamous. Birch trunks there are abnormally crooked at the bottom. They say people cannot stay there for too long, otherwise they risk losing their mind.(1) Several ancient Indian texts believed to have been written by Aryans recount similar rituals. ""These ancient Indian texts and hymns describe sacrifices of horses and burials and the way the meat is cut off and the way the horse is buried with its master ... If you match this with the way the skeletons and the graves are being dug up in Russia, they are a millimetre-perfect match.""(3) If archaeologists confirm the cities as Aryan, they could be the remnants of a civilisation that spread through Europe and much of Asia. Their language has been identified as the precursor of modern Indo-European tongues, including English. Words such as brother, guest and oxen have been traced back to this prototype.""Potentially, this could rival ancient Greece in the age of the heroes,"" said British historian Bettany Hughes, who spent much of the northern summer exploring the region for a BBC radio program, Tracking the Aryans.""We are all told that there is this kind of mother tongue, proto-Indo-European, from which all the languages we know emerge.(3) Several years ago archaeologists considered all sites of the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. as belonging to the Andronovo culture. Within the last decade, two additional, and yet more ancient cultures were discovered in Eurasia that have several characteristics in common. These were named ""Petrovka"" and ""Sintashta."" Located in the southern Ural region, they are dated to c. 2000-1600 B.C. (Gening, Zdanovich 1993, Zdanovich 1995, 1997) The former occupied the eastern region (Tobol -Ishim), and the latter the southern area. Previously, Sintashta settlements had been excavated but they had not been understood because of their difference from the classical Andronovo culture. Moreover, because the complexes contained some features belonging to the Abashevo culture, the original researchers had initially included them into the Abashevo sphere. The most diagnostic feature of the Sintashta settlement site is its closed fortification that consisted of ramparts and ditches, enforced by a fence or wall built from unfired clay bricks and wooden frames. The site plan was based on either a round or rectangular form. The fortified area included from 6,000 to 30,000 sq. meters. Towers and other constructions protected the entrances and the accesses to water (Zdanovich 1995). The houses were 25-130 sq.meters, rectangular and had pit-storage, open fire hearths, wells. Some also included metallurgical furnaces. Why had the individuality of Sintashta sites and their associated artifacts not been recognized earlier? And why are the sites still the subject of dispute? The crux of this matter is that frequently the more ancient deposits had been destroyed by subsequent layers of occupation. It was possible to understand the Sintashta settlement only after a another site had been investigated more recently. The Sintashta sites have been referred to as ""The Land of Towns "" (Gening, Zdanovich 1993, Zdanovich 1995). The cultue had occupied the territory along the eastern slopes of the Ural Mountains. The fortified settlement studied in most detail is Arkaim. Occupying 20,000 sq. meters, it was discovered in 1987 by the team headed by G. Zdanovich during salvage excavations before the construction of a dam. The excavation revealed that the settlement had been burned and, therefore, many details were preserved. The population, however, had vacated the city before the fire and took all their possession with them. Arkaim had two protective circular walls and two circles of standard dwellings separated by a street around a central square. The external wall, 160 m in diameter and 4 m wide, was built from specially selected soil that had been packed into timber frames before being faced with adobe bricks (Zdanovich 1997). On the interior, houses abutted the wall and were situated radially with their doors exiting to the circular internal street. Many interpretations have been suggested in relation to this site - a military fort, proto-city, or a ceremonial and religious center. The latter hypothesis appears reasonable, if we bear in mind that the sets of artifacts excavated were not characteristic of everyday usage. More plausible are the nterpretation put forward by researchers who regard sites such as Arkaim as combination of administrative and ceremonial centers. Possibly this was a location where about 1,000 to 2,000 peopleï¿½aristocracy (and craftsmen) gathered periodically to perform rituals.(4) The similarity of latitude, date, and size led some astronomers (Bystrushkin 2003) to compare Arkaim withStonehengein England. According to their claims, the Neolithic observatory at Stonehenge allowed for observation of 15 astronomical phenomena using 22 elements, whereas the contemporaneous observatory at Arkaim allowed for observation of 18 astronomical phenomena using 30 elements. They include sunsets and sunrises on the days of equinox and solstice, as well as sunsets and sunrises during low and high Moon.(1) ","(52.6494788, 59.5720987)",52.6494788,59.5720987,"A complex of 17 fortresses was discovered in the southern Urals in the region of Magnitogorsk, Troizk, and Orenburg.

The discovery of the agate bead necklace (below-right), dated at 7,500 - 7,000 BC demonstrates the level of specialisation attained at this site. Discoveries such as these along with other early discoveries from the middle-east are combining to overcome the prejudices of early archaeologists, who placed such finds as these into the category of 'Anomalous artefacts'. Today, with numerous other contemporary finds from the Anatolian highlands and across the middle-east, a contextual platform is slowly forming upon which to place such objects. This remarkable necklace was uncovered in 1989. It is made of burgundy agate and consists of ten polished beads all shaped between 2.5 cm and 5.5 cm in length and perforated longitudinally no more than 7-8 mm diameter, even though agate is 7 on the Mohs' scale of hardness. To drill similar holes today requires the use of a highly specialised diamond-tipped tungsten-carbide drill.(1)  'Researchers have recently analysed the oldest obsidian bracelet ever identified, discovered in the 1990's. Dated to 7,500 BC, the obsidian bracelet is unique.

The symmetry of the central annular ridge is extremely precise, to the nearest degree and nearest hundred micrometers.

"Atacama, Chile (Giant and Complex)",Giant and Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/chileatacama.htm,Atacama Desert,"However, the Atacama desert in Chile is also officially the oldest, driest desert in the world(1).Perhaps surprising then that it should also turn out to be the location of a vast sprawling prehistoric complex unlike any other in the Americas. Perhaps ironically, it is the historical lack of water in the region that has preserved the remains of this incredible discovery, which lies today, partially concealed beneath the silt of an ancient flood event. There are locations in the Atacama where not a single drop of rain has ever been recorded by humans. Researchers at Edinburgh University recently studied dry river beds which have had no water running through them for 120,000 years. They found loose sediment surfaces that would be washed away by any desert rainfall and these are older than 20 million years, making the region unique on earth.(5)For this reason, it is has been used by NASA to test Mars vehicles. However.... In 2003, a team of researchers published a report in the journalSciencetitled ""Mars-like Soils in the Atacama Desert, Chile, and the Dry Limit of Microbial Life"" in which they duplicated the tests used by the Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars landers to detect life, and were unable to detect any signs in Atacama Desert soil.(6) The Atacama desert is probably most famous for the huge petroglyph on the side of a hill called 'Cerro Unitas'. This is the largest prehistoric anthropomorphic figure in the world with a height of 119 metres and is suggested  to represent a deity for the local inhabitants c. 1000 to 1400 AD.(4) Because of its high altitude, dry air and nearly non-existent cloud cover, the Atacama desert is one of the best places in the world to conduct astronomical observations(2), supporting the suggestions that the Atacama Giant may have been built as a lunar calendar for knowing where the moon would set; from which the day, crop cycle, and season could be determined. The points on the top and side of the head are suggested to show which season it would be depending on their alignment with the moon, although as yet, there has been no substantial proof of this supposition. More than 5,000 geoglyphsï¿½prehistoric works of art placed on or worked into the landscapeï¿½have been recorded in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile over the past thirty years. The Chilean glyphs in the Atacama Desert are far more numerous and varied in style, cover a much larger region (150,000 km2 versus the 250 km2 of the Nazca lines), and are currently believed to have been constructed between 600 and 1,500 AD. Both the Nazca lines and the Atacama glyphs had multiple symbolic or ritual purposes; while some scholars believe the Atacama glyphs additionally had a vital role in the transportation network connecting the great South American civilizations. The Chilean glyphs were built and refined by several South American culturesï¿½likely including Tiwanaku, Inca, Atacameï¿½o as well as less-advanced groupsï¿½the widely varied geoglyphs are in geometric, animal and human forms, and in about fifty different types. Using artefacts and stylistic characteristics, archaeologists believe the earliest were first constructed during the Middle Period, beginning around 800 AD. The big question is... Were they built before or after the decline of the complex.  Although no housing or civil-structures have yet been officially identified, the complex is clearly man-made and measures at least 5 miles in diameter, so that whether is is a city, or an ancient agricultural system, it is still the largest known of its kind in prehistoric Chile and ranks alongside the largest man-made complexes in the Pre-Columbian America's. Apart form being next to the largest geoglyph in the world (Other Chilean Goeglyphs have been suggested to have been placed next to important trade routes), it can be seen that the complex was built at the end an ancient river system which is now essentially dried up. However, following the river bed east, it can be seen to originate from the region of the Salar Uyuny salt lake (approx 80 miles to the north - The large white object in the middle pictures, above). It is a reasonable to assume therefore that the complex was in operation at a time when this was a living lake, which would have supplied the area with all its water needs. Presumably, at some time in the distant past, when the lake was still filled with water, it would have flooding down onto the flatlands (seasonally?), engulfing different parts of the region in the process. If this was an agricultural operation, the annual flooding would have changed the course of the rivers, depositing large amounts of nutrient-rich silt in the process, a process which would have been invaluable to large-scale agriculture. The suggestion that the nearby 'Atacama Giant' was built as a lunar calendar to predict the seasons, supports the idea that parts (at least) of the complex were built for agriculture. This discovery was first noted by Ms. Holly Ahlberg (Nov, 2012) from whom the inspiration for this article came. At present, and following several e-mails to archaeologists and academics, there has been no reply concerning this discovery. The following images are taken from Google, and clearly show a vast and incredibly well laid out grid-network of fields and/or possible housing. Other structures such as canals, roads and civil structures have been tentatively identified. These pictures only show the smallest fraction of what what can be seen to have once been a vast complex extending out in the flood plain for several miles, consisting primarily of (several) thousands of similar plots, tightly grouped and laid out in neat grid formations. It is clear that whoever built these structures, they were well organised and the complex must have been of great significance when it was in operation. From what can be seen on Google-earth, it appears that many of the constructions lie beneath silt deposits, whilst others were built over pre-existing deposits, suggesting that what we are looking at is a complex that was built in several phases separated by different flood events, and/or over a period of time. The presence of numerous 'canals' leading to the structures highlights the possibility that it was built where it wasbecauseof the availability of water running from the now dried up Salar Uyuny salt flats (Once a freshwater lake and over 80 miles away).  The observation by Ms. Ahlberg, of the similarity in appearance between the areas of the site and modern salt-beds, certainly seems very credible in light of the environmental conditions, high salt content from the lake (particularly at the end of its life) and the location of the site in relation to the Inca highways, and by the sea - both of importance to a large-scale industrial operation. One road in particular appears significant. The road, which is approximately 30ft wide and with 4ft high banks on either side, runs from the Atacama giant straight to the heart of the complex. This road is connected at its northern end to Route 15, now tarmacked and constructed over an existing (Inca?) route which leads 150 miles directly east to Orouro in Bolivia. By following the road south to the heart of the complex, several significant facts emerge: Whilst the greater number of enclosures appear laid out in a grid-like checker-board fashion, perhaps more suggestive of a farming system (similar to paddy-fields), without roads, entrances or other features expected from dwellings, there are other structures visible which are more suggestive of housing and/or civil structures as the following images show: TheChinchorro, who lived in fishing settlements along the coast at that time, would have flourished under these relatively benign conditions. By combining 460 dates from 131 archaeological sites in the Atacama with existing data on how hunter-gather populations fluctuated elsewhere, the researchers developed a model which indicates that the Chinchorro experienced a hike in population density between 5,000ï¿½3,000 BC.(3)The Chinchorro however, did not practice agriculture, with the possible exception of growing reeds for mats and fiber. They used the products of their environment pelican beaks and feathers, seashells, sea lion hides, and even whalebone for practically all their needs. Some use of feathers and llama woo have been found, which would indicate the coastal Chinchorro traded with the inhabitants of the Andean highlands.(6) Around 2,000-1,000 BC, theAtacameï¿½opeople fully adopted the sedentary culture. At this stage, they had an economy mainly based on llama breeding andmaize agriculture. Between 400 BC and 100 AD, Atacameï¿½o farming reached a peak in its development.(1)As such, this is the most likely candidate for such a large scale operation of farming. However,regional climate records for the time, based on the periodic appearance of certain plants in the rock records, indicate that there was a period of greater rainfall across the Andes above the Atacama between 5,800 BC and 4,700 BC, which would have charged groundwater reserves in the usually dry desert of northern Chile and southern Peru.The Atacameno settlement of Tulor isone of the oldest and best-preserved Neolithic villages in South America.The architecture of the time had circular clay buildings, joined together, and with patios and passageways that communicated with one another. The rooms, whose foundations were set up on previously excavated grooves, were built in adobe in an arched form that reached a height of almost 2 meters, and finished off in a conical roof held by wooden poles.(7)They bear no resemblance however to the Nuevo Albergis structures. The nearby archaeological site of San Pedro de Atacama is a Tiwanaku Empire outpost, located in a desert oasis some 800 kilometres from the capital of the Tiwanaku empire, and at 2,430 meters above sea level in the foothills of the Andes mountains in the Atacama desert of extreme northern Chile. Whilst this appears to be a completely different system of  agriculture to the Tiahuanacans, (who preferred to use the raised-bed systems), the sheer scale of the operation suggests that it was both important and likely fed thousands of people, more than could be accounted for in this otherwise dry desert region of Chile. Perhaps what we are looking at here is a regional 'wholesale' supplier of food to one of the larger cultures such as the Tiahuanacan or Inca empires. Although rain rarely falls on the Atacama's coastline, a dense fog known ascamanchacais abundant. The fog nourishes plant communities calledlomas,isolated islands of vegetation that can contain a wide variety of species, from cactuses to ferns. The success of the cheap Chilean fog-catchers has inspired people in countries such as Peru, Ecuador, South Africa, and Namibia to develop similar systems for their arid-land homes.

1000 to 1400 AD.(4) Because of its high altitude, dry air and nearly non-existent cloud cover, the Atacama desert is one of the best places in the world to conduct astronomical observations(2), supporting the suggestions that the Atacama Giant may have been built as a lunar calendar for knowing where the moon would set; from which the day, crop cycle, and season could be determined.

"Avebury, England",Henge-Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandavebury.htm,"Avebury, England","Avebury isthelargest stone circle in the world: it is 427m (1401ft) in diameter and covers an area of about 28 acres (11.5 ha). The site is formed by a huge circular bank (roughly a mile around), a massive ditch, now only a half its original depth, and a great ring of 98 sarsen slabs enclosing two smaller circles of 30 stones each and other settings and arrangements of stones. Burl mentions evidence of athirdinner circle (see below), but so little remains that it is commonly forgotten as a part of the complex.  When originally built the bank would have been something like 27 metres wide at the base and 6 metres high. Theditchwas 9 metres deep and some 14 metres wide at the top, tapering to less than half that at the bottom. There were entrance causeways at the north, south, east and west. The henge is formed by a boundary ditch 15m (50ft) deep which runs between the outer bank and the great stone circle -The outer bank was originally 17m (55ft) high from ditch bottom to bank top and has a perimeter of over 1km. There are four entrances to the henge's bank and ditch. From the southern entrance a double avenue of standing stones called the Kennet Avenue, originally ran for 2.4 km and ended in two small stone circles and several circular wooden buildings. From another entrance ran theBeckhampton Avenue, 2km long, which once contained about 200 stones, of whichonly one is left standing today. Other important sites close by areStonehenge,    Windmill hill, a causewayed camp built in 3,350 BC before Avebury was built, AlsoSilbury hill, Europe's tallest artificial mound, and England's largest prehistoric tomb, the 104m (340ft) longWest Kennetlong barrow.   The stones for the large stone circle each weighing about 40 tons or more, were left rough and not dressed (as  the Stonehenge blocks were). The outer circle originally consisted of 98 stones (There are 98 lunar cycles each 8 solar years), which were obtained from the nearby Marlborough Downs. Now there are only 27 left, as many of the stones were broken up in the past, and used to construct the present village which grew up within the earthwork. There are two definite remaining stone circles inside the larger site of Avebury. One is located in the Northern sector of the Avebury ring and there are four of the 27 stones left today. The other is in the Southern sector of the ring and has five of the original 29 stones still standing. Although it is not commonly mentioned, a fourth circle has been shown to have once existed at Avebury. It was discovered in 1937 by 'A. Keiller', who found three 'unrecorded stone holes...eleven metres apart on the arc of a circle about 103m in diameter, much the same as the 'North' and 'South' inner circles, whose stones were also placed about eleven metres apart. The centre of this third circle was on the same North-north-west to South-south-east axis as the others and Keiller concluded that ""it seems impossible therefore not to conclude that what one may term as 'Avebury I' consisted of three settings of stones...unaccompanied by banks or ditches"". The phenomena of triple circles is not uncommon in the UK. The threeThornboroughHenges are similarly aligned as are several triple-stone circles. In the case of Thornborough, it has been suggested by Prof. Clive Ruggles, that they were made to mirror the three stars  of Orion's belt. A suggestion which has also been claimed for the three pyramids at Giza.   Two of the central stones (once three), are calledThe Cove, and may have been erected first, even before the great circle. The same feature can be seen atArbor LowandStennes. An attempt to straighten the two stones called 'The Cove' in 2003, revealed the fact that one of the stones, which stands 14ft (4.4m), above the ground, also exists at least 7ft (2.2m) below the ground (reaching a possible 10ft/3m deep). The weight of the stone is calculated at around 100 tons.   There were two ceremonial avenues of standing stones departing from the main ring. Only one survives, theWest Kennet Avenue, which was originally 2.5km (1.5 miles) in length and connected Avebury to the small stone circle calledThe Sanctuaryon Overton Hill.  The 'Beckhampton Way' leads east from Avebury, past several long-barrows, original destination unknown. To the prehistoric traveller however, arriving from the direction of the Ridgeway, it is noticeable that Silbury hill is completely obscuredfor the whole of the West-Kennet avenue, which is the natural route to Avebury from The Sanctuary. From the map below it can be seen that the Sanctuary is not only placed in a bend of the river Avon, but sits on theRidgeway, so that anyone arriving from either direction would have been naturally led to Avebury along the West Kennet Avenue (which would have incidentally had the effect of obscuring Silbury Hill behind 'Woden'/'Waden' Hill). In addition, the Beckhampton avenue also leads oneawayfrom Silbury. The Avebury/Silbury hill combination demonstrate the two basic elements found at several of other European complexes,  namely a conical mound (suggested as symbolising the 'mound of creation' and usually surrounded by water), and a prominent nearby stone circle. Although in this case the two are not inter-visible, their proximity and dominance on the landscape leaves no doubt that they were both part of a larger unified ceremonial landscape, connected with avenues and the natural folds of the Wiltshire countryside. The projection below however, demonstrates how easily the landscape can be changed and alters the whole context of Avebury/Silbury in the Process. Avebury,StonehengeandGlastonburyform a right angled triangle accurate to within 1/1000. The 'St. Michaels' ley-line from Glastonbury to Avebury coincides with the Mayday sunrise, crossing the longest possible stretch of Southern Britain.

From Salisbury plain, beginning at the southern end of the Avebury stone circle and extending for 200 miles north-westward to Norfolk, is the prehistoric highway called the 'Ikneild Way'. The road runs dead straight on level ground and follows perfectly the contour of the land in hilly areas. It has a level surface and widens at some places to the equivalent of a modern four-lane highway. It pre-dates the Romans by 2000 yrs(9). In addition, the Sanctuary is positioned alongside the Ridgeway, which leads to the north and would have been one of the most important prehistoric routes across Britain.

Axum was the ancient political and religious capital of Ethiopia. Though the exact date of its founding is not known, it is known that the Queen of Sheba, who reigned around 1000 B.C. had Axum as her royal capital. Axum was also rumoured to be the home of the Ark of the covenant. The kingdom of Aksum had its own written language called Ge'ez, and also developed a distinctive architecture exemplified by giant obelisks, the oldest of which (though much smaller) date from 5,000-2,000 BC.(2) The Northern Stelae Field contains more than 120 stelae made of smooth, grey stone.

"Azores, Portugal","Cart-ruts, Hypogea",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portoazores.htm,The Azores Islands,"The Azores islands are located roughly in the centre of the Atlantic ocean. They were formed by the tectonic activity along the centre of the Ocean floor. There are are nine islands in total, which first appear on Genoese Portellano's c. 1350. For a long time, reports circulated about the presence of ancient structures and artefacts on the islands. Although these have been consistently refuted, a new report has confirmed the rumours to have been of substance. The pertinent question now is no longerif, butwhoexactly were these prehistoric visitors to the islands. 'The president of the Portuguese Association of Archaeological Research (APIA), Nuno Ribeiro, revealed Monday having found rock art on the island of Terceira, supporting his belief that human occupation of the Azores predates the arrival of the Portuguese by many thousands of years'. The recent report by the President of the APIA has opened the floodgates to the perception of prehistoric activity on the islands. With archaeological discoveries having been made on most of the nine islands, there is now no doubt that they were occupied in the past. Similarities to Greek and Carthaginian remains are of particular interest as coins from the same period had been previously discovered on the island of Corvo(2)  'The 'Corvo Coins' refers to a hoard of coins dating to approximately 200 BCE that were reportedly left in theAzores byCarthaginians and discovered in 1749 on theisland of Corvo. The only source of information about the find is a report published in 1778 in 'Det Gï¿½theborgska Wetenskaps och Witterhets Samhallets Handlinger', now known as the Publications of theRoyal Society of Sciences and Letters in Gothenburg, byJohan Frans Podolyn, a Portuguese-bornSwede. According to Podolyn, in 1761 he met in Madrid the historian and numismatistEnrique Flï¿½rez who gave him 9 coins from Carthage (2 gold and 5 bronze) and 2 fromCyrene (bronze), which Flores said were from a hoard discovered in 1749 in a black pot or vase after being washed out of the foundations of a building by a storm'(3) In the year 1567, Damien deGoes, biographer of the sixteenth-century Portuguese kings, reported that a stone statue of a bareheaded man clothed in a Moorish cape and seated on a horse had been found at Corvo. His left arm rested on the horse's mane, while his right arm stretched straight out with the index finger pointing to the west. King Emmanuel of Portugal (1495-1521) sent for the statue, but those in charge of the project carelessly broke it. Nonetheless, the heads of the man and horse, and the right arm with the pointed finger are said to have been brought to the king's palace for display. DeGoesadded that in 1529 it was noted that the base on which the statue had stood was inscribed. Wax impressions of the inscriptions were made, but could not be read as the letters wereveryworn and ""almost without form."" In 1628, Manoel de Faria y Sousa, another Portuguese historian, repeated de Goes's tale. It might well have died there, but in 1778 Johan Podolyn added to this account a description of the statue of Corvo, citing Faria y Sousa as his source, and discussed the possibility that Carthaginian sailors discovered Corvo, settled there, erected the statue, and left the coins. He then ventured the opinion that these colonists undertook an expedition ""to the west,"" the statue indicating with its pointed finger where they had gone. Ibn Khordadbey (mid-ninth century) said that at the outermost end of the world, off the Spanish coast, there was a warning monument: a bronze horseman who, with his outstretched arm, indicates that beyond here there is no clear way, and anyone who ventures farther will be swallowed up. The myth of a warning statue found its way from Arab geographers to medieval European cartographers, and in 1367 made its clearest appearance on a map created by the Italian Pizigano brothers. At the edge of their map, just about where the Azores actually are, is a figure with an outstretched arm, and, next to it, a medallion with an inscription on it. The inscription is in part unintelligible, but the message is clear: there is a statue here and navigation beyond it is impossible.(7) It was famously recorded that Columbus and his wife moved to the island of Santo Maria. Here he learned that strange items had been washed upon the shore of local beaches including carved pieces of wood unlike any in Europe. There were huge hollowed out carved pine-tree trunks, which he would later discover were made by Indians and called ï¿½canoes.ï¿½ Most significant, two bodies of dead men washed up on shore. Their features differed from those of the known races, the known world of Columbusï¿½s day extending on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia, south to a cape 100 miles south of the Equator, to the east as far as China and Japan, and to the west as far as the Azores.(4)According to Bartolomï¿½ de las Casas, the two dead bodies that looked like those of Indians were found on the Portuguese Flores Island in the Azores. He said he found that fact in Columbus' notes, and it was one reason why Columbus presumed that India was on the other side of the ocean.(5) ""Whilst the art of navigation was yet in its infancy, the Gulf-stream suggested to the mind of Christopher Columbus certain indications of the existence of western regions. Two corpses, the features of which indicated a race of unknown men, were cast ashore on the Azores, towards the end of the 15th century. Nearly at the same period, the brother-in-law of Columbus, Peter Correa, governor of Porto Santo, found on the strand of that island pieces of bamboo of extraordinary size, brought thither by the western currents. The dead bodies and the bamboos attracted the attention of the Genoese navigator, who conjectured that both came from a continent situated towards the west. We now know that in the torrid zone the trade-winds and the current of the tropics are in opposition to every motion of the waves in the direction of the earth's rotation."" The presence of cart-ruts on the Azores is one of the most unexpected facts to present itself in the search for the first settlers on the Azores. These enigmatic features are found in large numbers around the Mediterranean basin, in Italy, Portugal, France, and most famously on Malta. The Portuguese cart-ruts are pre-Christian, as are those on Malta. As we have no record of their being made since the 'official' discovery of the Azores, we must assume that these were made by a people prior to the Portuguese. There are three physical explanations for the existence of cart-ruts. They are: 1). They were carved into the rock to facilitate the passing of some form of vehicles. 2). They were worn naturally by the passing of numerous vehicles over a long period of time. 3). They were made by the passing of a single vehicle over a soft substrate which has since solidified. All of these possibilities pose problems in the case of the Azores: The first alternative requires a large supply of manpower, lots of time and a considerable motivation. The second requires considerably more time and an immense amount of traffic (in order to carve such deep tracks into rock). The third option is entirely refuted by geologists. As we have no record of such practices by the Carthaginians or Greeks, we probably need to look elsewhere to find the origin of these most peculiar geological features. The Maltese cart-ruts have now shown to have an association with the temple building period c. 3,000 BC. Not only are the stones used to build the temples the same dimensions as the 'gauge' of the tracks, but they are found close to the temples themselves. Again, none of these facts appear to be relevant on the Azores so for now, at least, the very existence of what is essentially a 'prehistoric' feature is one of the islands most fascinating mysteries. The presence of  'Dozens of Hypogea'(1)on Terceira and Corvo, along with indications of 'Additional Hypogea sites on the island of Flores' is a strong indication that the islands were home to a considerable population of people, more than one would expect from a single, random encounter with the island. The wide distribution and presence on more than one island combined with their frequency supports the idea that the islands were peopled by a deliberate act of extensive population. 'Archaeologists from the Portuguese Association of Archaeological Research (APIA) believe to have found in the Azores a significant number of Carthaginian temples from the fourth century BC, dedicated to the goddess Tanit' ... 'More than five hypogea type monuments and at least three 'sanctuaries' were found' ... 'The temples carved inside the hypogea structures are large and very well preserved and were drawn almost in a triangular shape' ... 'There are chairs carved into the rock, a ceremonial tank,, sinks linked to conduits to collect fresh water associated with ritual libations, probably for sacrificial purposes'.(2) The implications of a deliberate emigration of people to the centre of the Atlantic ocean in prehistoric times is probably the very reason why the idea has been rejected for so long. Such acts of population are not simple leaps of faith, they have to be planned and executed with a great presence of mind, involving a knowledge of navigation, the location of the islands (longitude/latitude?), sea-going vessels, a large number of people, skills, stocks, supplies, tools... etc etc. ","(37.7412488, -25.6755944)",37.7412488,-25.6755944,"For a long time, reports circulated about the presence of ancient structures and artefacts on the islands.
'The president of the Portuguese Association of Archaeological Research (APIA), Nuno Ribeiro, revealed Monday having found rock art on the island of Terceira, supporting his belief that human occupation of the Azores predates the arrival of the Portuguese by many thousands of years'.
According to Podolyn, in 1761 he met in Madrid the historian and numismatistEnrique Flï¿½rez who gave him 9 coins from Carthage (2 gold and 5 bronze) and 2 fromCyrene (bronze), which Flores said were from a hoard discovered in 1749 in a black pot or vase after being washed out of the foundations of a building by a storm'(3) In the year 1567, Damien deGoes, biographer of the sixteenth-century Portuguese kings, reported that a stone statue of a bareheaded man clothed in a Moorish cape and seated on a horse had been found at Corvo.
Nonetheless, the heads of the man and horse, and the right arm with the pointed finger are said to have been brought to the king's palace for display.
Ibn Khordadbey (mid-ninth century) said that at the outermost end of the world, off the Spanish coast, there was a warning monument: a bronze horseman who, with his outstretched arm, indicates that beyond here there is no clear way, and anyone who ventures farther will be swallowed up.
The inscription is in part unintelligible, but the message is clear: there is a statue here and navigation beyond it is impossible.(7) It was famously recorded that Columbus and his wife moved to the island of Santo Maria.
Their features differed from those of the known races, the known world of Columbusï¿½s day extending on the north to Iceland and Scandinavia, south to a cape 100 miles south of the Equator, to the east as far as China and Japan, and to the west as far as the Azores.(4)According to Bartolomï¿½ de las Casas, the two dead bodies that looked like those of Indians were found on the Portuguese Flores Island in the Azores.
He said he found that fact in Columbus' notes, and it was one reason why Columbus presumed that India was on the other side of the ocean.(5) ""Whilst the art of navigation was yet in its infancy, the Gulf-stream suggested to the mind of Christopher Columbus certain indications of the existence of western regions.
Two corpses, the features of which indicated a race of unknown men, were cast ashore on the Azores, towards the end of the 15th century.
As we have no record of their being made since the 'official' discovery of the Azores, we must assume that these were made by a people prior to the Portuguese.

"Ba'albek, Lebanon",Temple Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/lebanonbaalbek.htm,Baalbek-Heliopolis,"The temple at Ba'albek is famous for its extraordinarily large foundation stones (The largest in the world). These stones also qualify as the largest cut-stones in the history of mankind. 'The first syllable 'Baal' corresponds to the Sun of the ancient Phoenicians. The Syriac termination 'Bak' means town; the Phoenician ending 'Beka' means 'country'. However, in a recently discovered Phoenician inscription, the word 'Beka' has the meaning of town. In Egyptian, the word 'Bak' also means town'.(1) While Lebanon is mentioned in the bible for its cedar-wood, it is perhaps curious that the Ba'albek temple was not also mentioned. (except perhaps as Solomon's  temple in Lebanon). The stones used for the construction of the temple platform at Baalbek stand on record as the largest known quarried, cut-stones in prehistory (Three of which are regularly estimated at 800 - 1,200 tons each). "" ...turn our thoughts to the temple of Solomon - to his own house, to his house of the forest of Lebanon - the former of which, even the second temple, we know from Josephus, was made of stones immensely large; and as to the latter, the sacred historian tells us, that "" the foundation was of costly stones; even great stones; stones of ten cubits and  stones of eight cubits."" And if we take into account that Huran, a Phoenician, and his servants, who were Phoenicians, assisted in building Solomons temple...""  The photo (left) of the western wall of the 'Temple of Jupiter', shows the layers of foundation stones which were brought to light when the Arabs dug out moats around the edifice. The basement of the terrace is seen to be supported by six immense stones measuring 33 ft long each and 14ft high (right of the person in photo). These stones hold the weight of the three giant stones (the so calledTrilithon), which were intended to support the last row, that should have been the higher edge of the terrace, but was never built. The similarity between the 'cyclopean' masonry in the foundations of the temple and the unfinished block (in the quarry) suggests that  the stone in the quarry (see below), was cut in the earliest stages of the temples development. The early date of the temple foundations and the advanced skills of the masons reveals the presence of an unknown page of history as the only two ancient cultures in the middle-east with monoliths anywhere near this size were at Giza in Egypt and Jerusalem in Israel.  'In the course of his questioning he(Herodotus)encountered one Manetho, an Egyptian High Priest, scholar and Historian, with whom he conversed at length thru the agency of an interpreter. Manetho informed his distinguished guest that the architect of the huge mass of stone was one ""Philition"", or ""Suphis"", of a people known as the ""Hyksos"", that is ""Shepherd Kings"". According to Manetho, the Shepherd Kings were ""a people of ignoble race"" who came from some unknown land in theEast; they were a nomadic band who numbered not less than 280,000 souls; they brought with them their families and all mobile possessions, including vast flocks of sheep and herds of cattle; and they ""had the confidence to invade Egypt, and subdued it without a battle"". this same people, said Manetho, overthrew the then-reigning Dynasty, stamped out idolatry and endeavoured to firmly establish in the place thereof the worship of the One true God having completed the Great pyramid, migrated eastward into the land afterwards known as Judea and founded there the city of Salem, which later became Jerusalem, the Holy city.'(6) According to Estfan Doweihi, the Maronite Patriarch of Lebanon: 'Tradition states that the fortress of Baalbek... is the most ancient building in the world. Cain, the son of Adam, built it in the year 133 of the creation, during a fit of raving madness. He gave it the name of his son Enoch and peopled it with giants who were punished for their iniquities by the flood.'  The proximity of the granite quarry to the temple appears at first glance to explain the location of the temple, however, other ancient sites such asGhizaorStonehenge(etc, etc), were located up to 500 Km distant from the nearest source of granite, and it has been shown that the temple at Baalbek is aligned with other prominent ancient sites, which opens the possibility that the determination of the site may also have been realised according to geodetic principles. As well as being cardinally aligned and composed of immense blocks,    Ba'albek shares a geometric relationship withGiza, Egypt. The same 'geodetic fingerprint' can be seen at other significant Egyptian Temple complexes like Karnak (Thebes) and Giza, and appears to be related to the positioning of sacred places in the middle east and Europe from a geodetic centre-point at Giza (or perhaps at Heliopolis). Although it is still in its infancy, the study of prehistoric geodesy is now being recognised as a serious scientific study both then and now. Dimensions -There are several varying sources regarding the dimensions of this stone. As such, they have all been compiled in the following chart. The same is true of the three foundation blocks 'The trilithon', in the nearby Baalbek temple, which have the following dimensions: The largest is 65 feet in length, the second 64 ft 10 inches; and the third 63ft 2 inches. They are all 14 ft and 6 inches in height, and 12 feet in thickness. Each block is therefore 350 cubic yards and they are estimated to weigh 750 - 1,000 tons each(1). How was the stone moved -The ancient manipulation of such large stones is still a largely debated phenomena.  Common to  other similar ancient construction feats, there are no records to testify the means or date of this extraordinary achievement. However, the similarity to other extremely early middle-eastern masonry achievements, such as those seen atGhizaorAbydoss, in Egypt and the foundations of the 'Temple of the mount' inJerusalem, have not gone un-noticed. Likewise, there appears to be a connection in the type of stone used, which was invariably quartzite (Red granite in the case of Baalbek). In the past such achievements were accredited to 'The hand of God', 'Giants' and more recently 'Alien life'. However, we must be careful not to lose ourselves in disbelief. There is no doubt that these stones were moved, and as with most suchunexplainableevents, there is likely to be a rational answer if we look for it. For example, theColossi of Memnon, in Egypt are both estimated to weigh 1000 tons each, and their movement is clearly depicted in hieroglyphs. Why was the stone moved- Just as important as understanding how they were moved, is the question ofwhysuch immense stones were moved. (Any increase in advantage gained by using large stones is balanced against the increased difficulties of moving them). In Egypt, for example, we can see numerous 85-ton stones that were moved over 500 km to their resting places in and around the great pyramid. The proximity of the quarry to the temple is close enough that it could be argued that the stones did notneedto be moved, at least in terms of laying a foundation, as it would have been more effective to build the temple directly into the bedrock. This raises the question, why bother at all? The idea that the temple was solar reasonably justifies the moving of the stones uphill, as placing the temple on top of the hill enabled it to capture the rays of the sun at the appropriate times of the year (the equinoxes). The choice of such large stones however, as with many ancient structures, might be better explained through the idea of a form of worship of thestoneitself.

"Bagneux Dolmen, France",Dolmen,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/franceloire.htm#bagneux,"The Loire Dolmens, France","This group of dolmens  is congregated between Samur to Blois, on the river Loire are some of the most impressive in France. They are puzzling to archaeologists as none of them appear to have ever been covered with earth, and there have been no human remains found in them, which precludes them from having been intended for passage mounds or funerary structures.(1) The Loire dolmens were constructed with huge granite slabs, often seen with squared-off edges and corners, the largest chamber at Bagneux is so big that one has the feeling that one might be entering a temple or meeting chamber. The   largest 'dolmen' in France- It has has four massive capstoneseach about 2ft thick with the largest estimated 'very accurately by Vice-Admiral Boyle Summerville to weigh just over 86 tons'.  A   plaque at the site tells us that the overall length of the dolmen is   23m (75ft), with the internal chamber at over 18m (60ft) in length and   at least 3m high.   There are no carvings or markings present. This site is unlike any   other (remaining) and the specific design suggests a function. As   with the other Saumur dolmens, it was built with large stone slabs,   squared and trimmed in a style particular to this area. This spectacular 'dolmen' is one of the largest in all Europe. Although the capstoneis now broken into four pieces, it is estimated to have originally weighed in at around 100 tons. This is strictly not a dolmen, but rather a 'portalled chamber', with a distinct portalled entrance and several internal supporting stones (under the cracks in the capstone), which now divide the chamber into smaller sections. It opens to the south-east, suggesting a possible orientation towards the winter solstice sunrise. Location: On the D69 just south-east of Gennes, Nr Saumur. This 'Dolmen' is   located on a hill with a good view of the surrounding countryside.   It is approximately 10m long, 4m wide and around 3.5m high.    The structure, when compared with other giant local dolmen, has   less squared stones, and a more 'natural' feel to the shape of the   stones and the way they were put together, suggesting an earlier   construction. The Dolmen de la Madelaine has a   (Possibly incidental) side entrance at one end and is open-ended at the other. This   design is unlike any other of the Saumur 'dolmens', although the   three cap-stones and overall style, size and 'square-ness' are.  Location: East ofBaugeand   accessible along a track through woodland. It is constructed in   the same style as the other dolmens of the region, with a portalled entrance and a huge cap-stone which is now broken in   two. Thesmallestdolmen in France?- There are several other   dolmens along this stretch of the Loire, mostly built to the same   scale as those above, but it is ironic that in this very same area   of such giant structures, that the smallest dolmen (That I've   seen) in France can also be found. This dolmen lies   east ofLandes de Gaulois,nearBlois. It stands   under 1m high, and is just over a metre in width and depth. The   similarity in design to its giant neighbours (such as thesixcompletely unnecessary supporting stones), gives it the appearance   of a 'dwarf' dolmen, or possibly a scale model, anyway the stark   contrast with other structures in the area results in a guaranteed   chuckle  for any intrepid hunter.  Not   far from this miniature dolmen, isLa Pierre Levee, (or'La Table-du-Diablo' - The Devil's table), which is   constructed in the same style as, but nowhere nearly as grand as   its giant Loire neighbours. It has good visibility, and was made   from noticeably different rock to the ones near Saumur and Tours.   It is dated at around 3,500BC. This dolmen lies   on the D957, just north of Blois. The information plaque at the   site identifies another ten dolmens and menhirs in the immediate   vicinity. As with other dolmens in the area, it has a portal   entrance and it is orientated east/west with its entrance facing   the sunrise at the equinoxes.   'Bouche Dolmen'- This dolmen is located in a farmers field nearBouche. It is   partially collapsed, and has the appearance of having had one or   two of the support stones pulled out from under one side. Before   its collapse, it would have had a portalled entrance, and is   similar in size toLa Pierre couvert(above). The capstone   is split in half as atLa Pierre couvert, but with squared-off ends.  Other dolmens can also be found north of the Loire at Soucelles, La Roche Thibault, Bauge, Nr Mettray (La Grotte des Fees). South of the river in the Samur region there are more west of Gennes and in a farmyard near St. Hilaire (Dolmen de la Pierre Boire), and the massiveLe Gros-Chillouat Briancon, Cravant, which is 50 ft (15.2 metres) long and 10 ft (3.1 metres) high.

"Balfarg, Scotland",Henge-Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/scotlandbalfarg.htm,"Balfarg, Scotland","Balfarg henge is uniquely situated in the centre of a housing estate, surrounded by a circular road and ring of houses which were built in 1977 and 1978. The Balfarg henge is part of a larger prehistoric ceremonial complex which was in use for over 1500 years. It contains the remnants of a stone circle which has been partly reconstructed.  Traces of the enclosing bank exist to a height of 6 to 8 inches on the north and east; its original diameter could have been about 280 feet. The two standing stones are of undressed sandstone and lie some 45 feet apart. That on the north-west, 6 feet 7 inches high, was probably one of a pair set in the entrance-gap; the other, 5 feet 3 inches high, the survivor of a ring of stones set some 20 feet within the ditch and concentric with it. The Balfarg henge was excavated between 1977 and 1978 byRoger Mercer prior to the development of a new housing estate, work which established that the two extantstanding stones were part of a circle that stood within the henge. The two surviving stones lined the north-west oriented entrance to the henge.(1) Within the 64.9m diameter henge (comparable toBrodgar), were found broken Neolithic pottery, burnt wood and bone which had been dumped on the site prior to the erection of a 25m widetimber circle of 16 wooden posts. Two especially large portal timbers stood on the west side of the circle. It is likely that the henge was built after these phases of activity.Grooved ware pottery found in thepostholes dates to around 2,900 BC. Some of the vessels may have been used to hold blackhenbane (Hyoscyamus niger) which is a poison but also a powerful hallucinogen. This has reinforced the suggestion that the site was a 'ceremonial' centre. The specialist report included in the excavation publication identified high pollen values and seed numbers of henbane (Moffat 1993). Organic residues adhering to pottery sherds, which had been broken and often scorched at the time of deposition, were examined by Moffat. The context of these sherds, associated with what has been identified as a ritual monument, and the manner of deposition, has been interpreted as ritual activity. The presence of henbane in significant concentrations has been interpreted as the use of a hallucinogenic drug, as part of these ritual activities. To date, excavations at other `ritual' sites have not been able to produce comparable evidence for the use of poisonous or hallucinogenic plants at these sites (Long 1998) and Balfarg is unique in this respect. However, this evidence has been used to support theories of the use of hallucinogenic drugs in the Scottish Neolithic and parallels have been drawn to the use of other members of the Solanaceae in South America and Australia (Sherratt 1996). An approximate chronology from the Balfarg/ Balbirnie complex (Barclay & Russell-White 1993) suggests that ceremonial activity lasted from the 4th to the 2nd millennium BC (uncalibrated). Organic residues adhering to three types of pottery were examined. These three groups are defined by Cowie (1993) as Early Neolithic Cowie Group 1 and 2 and Grooved Ware vessels. Radiocarbon dating of associated charcoal indicates an age range spanning some 1000 years, between 3710 and 2610 years cal BC (Barclay & Russell-White 1993: 160-61). Sherds of different vessels were deposited in separate locations and sometimes sherds from a single pot were deposited in different locations (Barclay & Russell-White 1993: 187). This and the low numbers of sherds means that context is difficult to interpret although Richards and Barclay (in Barclay & Russell-White 1993: 187-92) suggest that deposition may have had ritual significance as all pottery appears to have been used, broken and often burnt prior to deposition on site. There is no evidence that sherds were removed from the site. Richards (1993) interprets this as evidence that the sherds were `ritually charged'. Botanical evidence from the residues consisted of a pollen assemblage identified on one sherd (Pot 63) that included significant proportions of henbane (Hyoscyamus niger), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), goosefoot (Chenopodiaceae) and cabbage/mustards (Brassicaceae). A `small cache' of henbane seeds was also identified in the residue of this same sherd (Moffat 1993). No comparable evidence was found in residues from other sherds examined by Moffat. There is no indication published of the number of pollen grains or seeds involved. Assessment of pollen preservation can be used to indicate the reliability of a pollen assemblage by highlighting those assemblages with high proportions of poorly preserved pollen, which can suggest differential preservation of the assemblage. However, published information from the 1997 study does not allow this assessment of reliability. This makes re-interpretation and further use of these data difficult to the extent that re-analysis is the only way to assess their reliability. Henbane has profound and intoxicating properties (Cooper & Johnson 1984): the plant is poisonous and ingestion causes euphoria, hallucinations, blurred vision, dizziness, rapid heartbeat and eventually death when consumed in excess. Grieve (1931) suggests that the leaves, flowering tops and seeds are most frequently used in medical preparations and adds that boiling does not destroy the toxic properties of the plant. Seeds, however, have 10 times the strength of the leaves and Grieve (1931) specifies that although a dose of 20 seeds has not proved fatal to adults, reactions to this dose would include vomiting, loss of consciousness and sometimes suffocation.(2) ","(56.22059600000001, -3.153336)",56.22059600000001,-3.153336,"The two surviving stones lined the north-west oriented entrance to the henge.(1) Within the 64.9m diameter henge (comparable toBrodgar), were found broken Neolithic pottery, burnt wood and bone which had been dumped on the site prior to the erection of a 25m widetimber circle of 16 wooden posts.

"Beltany, Ireland",Stone Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/irelandbeltany.htm,"Beltany, Ireland","The nameBeltanyis probably derived fromBaal Tinne, meaningBaal's Fire, and Beltane was an ancient festival celebrating the sun. The festival of Beltane marked the end of the spring and the beginning of the summer and is the counterpart of Samhaim, the festival that marks the beginning of the winter. Both the deity as the festival are associated with growth and fecundity. This festival was held on the first day of May. On the levelled summit of Tops Hill, about two miles south of the village of Raphoe, is this fine stone circle, one of the few in NW Ireland. The name Beltany suggests that the pagan festival of Beltane,traditionally associated with the lighting of hill-top fires to regenerate the sun, was celebrated on the site. The ring is 44.2m (145ft) in diameter and currently contains around 64 stones, though originally there were an estimated eighty with average heights of 1.8m. The style is similar to the circles in the Carrowmore cemetery; it is possible that Beltany is a transitional ring between late passage-tombs and early stone circles or a combination of both. The circle, which is substantially older than the Iron Age, surrounds a tumulus. The tumulus may be the remains of a pillaged cairn, and some theories claim that the whole site should be really classified as a round cairn with the orthostats comprising a kerbing. (A Kerbed Passage mound) The site was disturbed at the beginning of the century resulting in many of the stones to lean outward at acute angles.

On the levelled summit of Tops Hill, about two miles south of the village of Raphoe, is this fine stone circle, one of the few in NW Ireland.
The name Beltany suggests that the pagan festival of Beltane,traditionally associated with the lighting of hill-top fires to regenerate the sun, was celebrated on the site.
The style is similar to the circles in the Carrowmore cemetery; it is possible that Beltany is a transitional ring between late passage-tombs and early stone circles or a combination of both.",Ireland,Europe

It is aligned through the central menhir to nearbyMen-An-Tol. William Stukeley believed this to be the first ring erected by incoming druids. It is situated near to Lands End at the southern most point of England. Analysis of the circleï¿½s architecture suggests that the central stone is likely to have been erected before the rest of the circle; it is shaped like an axe and contains relief carvings of two stone axes at the bottom of the stone. Several sources of greenstone, from which many Cornish polished stone axes were made, are found in west Cornwall and it has been suggested that the Boscawen Un circle was built to celebrate the axe.The circle has been restored and now sits on private land. Focused around Boscawen Un stone circle were the sites of four barrows, only one of which is still upstanding and this is now in poor condition. The stones have their smoother sides facing inwards. To the South West of the rings centre is a tall pillar which now leans considerably. Thom classified this ring as a Type B flattened circle which suggests that it was marked out with a geometric basis. The construction of such ""circles"" is based on that cornerstone ofsacred geometry, the Vescica Pisces.  A large gap in the west may be the site of an entrance.Lockyear believed that the quartz stone placed W-SW of the ring was placed in honour of the May day Sun, which would have risen over the centre of the circle. The leaning stone aligns exactly with the centre stone ofMen-An-Tol, it was determined by archaeology to have been positioned like this originally suggesting a deliberate alignment of the two sites. It is angled at approximately 53ï¿½ and points towards the midsummer sunrise in the NE. The number nineteen may also be significant as both the nearbyMerry Maidensand Tregeseal East stone circles also comprise nineteen stones. William Borlase noticed this and suggested that it related to the twelve months of the year and the number of days in the week. The 18.61 year cycle between major lunar standstills is widely known. It is interesting to note that the longer axis is aligned with the northern minor lunar standstill, which may also be significant here. John Michell has identified seven alignments passing through Boscawen-Un, including one which runs from the circle in the direction of  the Samhain sunrise. This alignment, also noted by Sir Norman Lockyer, includes a menhir at Trelew (SW 4217 2693) from which W. C.

"Boyne Valley, Ireland",Passage Mound Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/irelandboynevalley.htm,"Boyne Valley complex, Ireland","The Boyne valley complex is recognised as one of the jewels in Europe's megalithic crown. The passage mounds of Newgrange, Knowth and Dowth were built around 3200 BC Description  The manpower and organisation behind the construction of these monuments is on a civil scale. The guides at the site tell us that the average human lifetime at that time was only 35 years and they estimate it took 70 years to build, from which we can assume they weren't built as tombs...  The inscribed kerb-stone that lies directly in   front of the entrance to the Newgrange passage mound has the   triple spiral on the left hand side (also seen on the wall inside   the chamber). Almost identical art has been found on the Orkneys,   and variations of it can be seen throughout the ancient world. The 6,000-year-old relic, thought to be a     fragment from a larger piece, was left exposed by storms. Local     plumber David Barnes, who found the stone on the beach in     Sandwick Bay, South Ronaldsay, said circular markings had shown     up in the late-afternoon winter sun, drawing his attention to     the piece. Archeologists last night heralded the     discovery as a ""once-in- 50-years event"". But they warned that a     search for other fragments in the area would be hampered by a     lack of funds.  Archaeologists compared the discovery to     the Westray Stone (below), a Neolithic carved stone discovered     in 1981 during routine quarrying work. It has been in Orkney     Museum for more than 25 years but is due to be returned to the     area this week and exhibited in the new Westray Heritage Centre     in Pierowall. The Westray Stone was once part of a     Neolithic chambered cairn which is thought to have been     destroyed in prehistory. A second part, and two smaller carved     pieces, were found the following spring in a dig led by Niall     Sharples, of the University of Cardiff. ""The stone is perhaps from a chambered tomb     and could be as old as 5,000 or 6,000 years, and would have     possibly been used as a ceremonial, sacred object. This is art     made in the same style as art from the Newgrange stone tomb in     Ireland or tombs in Brittany.

Ancient objects without an owner are automatically property of     the Crown. But Mrs Gibson added: ""An object like this becomes     the property of everyone.""

This   exact design is seen at another site in Ireland (Fourknocks),   and atGavr'inisin France, where   the stone is on the floor, halfway along the passage.

The use of the site appears to have changed over time. It started as a stone circle surrounded by a bank and internal ditch. In the centre was a standing stone covered in carvings, including spirals and zigzag patterns. A Passage grave was built inside the ditch, with a North-east entrance. Finally, the whole passage was covered with a cairn. Some time before the pillar and its surrounding megaliths were erected, the stone was taken down and buried in the middle of the original ring, outside the chamber. This stone has been taken from its ancient setting to be stored in the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff, and a replica casting has been erected in the socket of the original stone. (16). Article:BBC News (18 June 2006)  At the winter solstice, the dagger of sunlight would have reached the top of the pillar but for a concrete lintel recently placed to secure the roof.(16) The pillar and stone edge are also positioned to accurately measure the Venus cycle and the winter solstice.(16) The spring and autumn equinoxes are marked by the sunlight moving onto the carved rock behind the pillar and splitting to light up the sides of the chamber with its patterns and cup markings.(16) On the summer solstice the runs rays illuminate the chamber through the reflectivity of the quartz. For a few minutes only it is directed to illuminate a small carved double spiral on stone slab left of the entrance. It has been shown that this shape is achieved by focusing and plotting the suns path over 366 days.(16) The passage was blocked except for a small opening that didn't allow access. (light-box). Platforms of white quartz pebbles, hearths and a structure surrounding the skeleton of an ox, found outside the mound, suggest rituals.

One of the stones from the light-box at Newgrange (right) has a particular design on it which can be found at two other passage mounds:Gavr'inisin France, andFour knocksin Ireland. AtMaes Howe, the light of the setting solstice sun was restricted by the closing of a  'portal stone',  placed into the side of the passage. In this way, at the right moment, the stone could be closed across the passage, and the light would only pass over the top (as atNewgrange).

The   research by Dr. Pires Gonï¿½alves   in the 1970's concluded that the monument was probably erected   between 4,000 BC and 3,000 BC and that its original design had   been quadrangular, consisting of 55 menhirs between 1.2 - 1.5   metres high. The stones are described as being both phallic and   rounded as at Almendres. It took Gonï¿½alves until 1972 to complete   the reconstruction. The azimuth of 100ï¿½ between Almendres and Xarez cromeleques has also been tentatively suggested as having been related to the azimuth of the full spring moon(3). Of interest is the fact that the spectacularAnta Grande da Zambujeiroalso sits along the same proposed 50km 'alignment', although none of the sites are inter-visible. The same alignment continues eastwards towards Lisbon.  Da Silva and Calado proposed that: 'A very simple observation could have been realized in megalithic times, in which the azimuths of the rising Sun and of the rising Full Moon, after Midwinter, are getting closer until they cross-over, i.e. until the Full Moon is seen to rise South of the direction in which the Sun was observed to rise in the same day.

It is occasionally referred to as 'mushroom-shaped' or 'Uterus' shaped, but its shape varies depending on where one stands.

"Carnac, France","Alignments, Circles etc",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/francecarnac.htm,"The Carnac complex, France","This particular region of France contains one of the highest concentrations of megalithic activity in all Europe. It includes stone-circles, alignments, dolmens, menhirs, passage-mounds and tumuli. The alignments are the largest in the world, and are estimated to have once included over 4,000 stones (now around 3,000). Carnac is located at the unique latitude on the Earth at which the solstice sun, both summer and winter, form a perfect Pythagorean triangle relative to the parallel of latitude, that is to the east-west, equinoxial axis of the site. In turn, this 3:4:5 triangle is the first of the Pythagorean triangular set and is expressed in the dimensions of the Crucuno monument. Carnac is one of the largest megalithic complexes in Europe, and while it is tempting to see the region as a collection of separate sites, it should be recognised that an astronomical connection between sites was established by Thom(2), and that in the Neolithic age the sea level in the areawasroughly 30ft lower than it is todayremoving any physical barrier between sites (such as Gavr'inis and Er-Lannic). The re-use of megaliths in the area can be used to determine connections between otherwise unrelated sites such as between the passage-mounds of Gavr'inis and La Table des Marchands for example, both of which incorporated pieces of an earlier monument into their structures (capstones) at around 3,100 BC. J. Michell says that the site was named Carnacafterthe EgyptianKarnakby the Count Maudet de   Penhouet(1), although the1864 surveyby M. Bertrand offers a different picture, tracing the ' Carnac is home to some of the earliest megaliths in Europe. It shows several distinct phases of construction, denoted by the occasional re-use of existing monuments. The following is a basic breakdown of the main prehistoric construction phases at Carnac. TheKercadopassage mound, south-east of the Kermario alignment produced Radio-Carbon dates of 4,700 BC. The mound is surrounded by a circle of stones and has a menhir on its peak. The entrance of the chamber faces 32ï¿½south of east, almost exactly towards midwinter sunrise.(3) The only relatively clear date for the alignments   is provided by the Manio Tumular bank, an early monument (5th millennium   B.C.) covered by the ends of the Kermario alignments, which must therefore   be considered more recent. Le Grand Menhir alignment (and other parts of   Lochmariaquer site), have been dated at c. 4,500 BC Parts of Le Grand Menhir alignment are re-used as   capstones for La Table des Marchands (over an existing stone), Er-Grah,   and the Gavr'inis passage mounds. The alignments at Carnac are believed to have been built at this time. Burl indicates a date of around 3,300 BC with an error of several hundred years Several researchers have determined that astronomy was an important factor in the design of many of the structures in the Carnac complex. The site shows several similarities with other western European 'complexes' such as theBoyne Valley complexin Ireland, The Salisbury (Silbury hill) complex in England or theOrkneys complexin Scotland, all of which are dated to the same approximate time, and all of which appear to consider astronomy as a fundamental, if not the sole requisite of these complexes. The entrances to both theGavrinisandKercadopassage mounds are orientated to the Winter solstice. Both passage-mounds are dated at around 3,300 BC. The last section of the Kermario alignment is in line with the Dec 21st Sunset (234.2ï¿½),   and/or the June 21st sunrise (54.2ï¿½). TheGrand Menhir Brisï¿½was once a lunar 'back-sight' for several other constructions in the area, all located so as to be able to accurately calculate the complete 18.6 year lunar cycle.(2)  Construction techniques -The Carnac builders were clearly qualified stone masons and as such they were  adept at techniques such as quarrying and splitting hard stone like granite, (which was the preferential stone for the megalithic builders all across Europe). The following shots from Carnac illustrate that the method used 5,000 years ago was similar to that used by masons today. Hidden amongst the thousands of megaliths in the area are seven great Tumuli, several of which extend over 100m in length, and rise to a height averaging over 10m. These Tumuli have produced Radio-carbon dated goods from dates as far back as 6,850 BC. (4), which makes them a fundamental part of any prehistoric landscape at Carnac. Tumulus St. Michel-    Their initial purpose of this mound was clearly funerary, as the sealed stone cyst inside yielded large numbers of finely crafted jadeite axe-heads and other precious goods such as turquoise beads, alongside burnt human remains. It is interesting to note that the Tumulus St. Michel was cardinally orientated at this early time and was located so as to include small island long-sights both to the east and west. Carnac's patron saint is St Cornï¿½ly, who is also the patron   saint of cattle, and a bull cult still lingers in the parish church on tumulus St. Michel, which   'displaysan image of the saint blessing two paintings of bulls surrounded   by menhirs and dolmens. The four main alignments run east from the hamlet of Le Menec, part of which lies within a large stone circle, which was determined by Prof A. Thom to have been made with a geometric foundation. The alignments are believed to have been erected at around 3,300 BC The 12 parallel rows were graded in height starting with the largest stones at the west (The village end), decreasing in height until the alignment terminates at another 'egg-shaped' circle. The stones are not only graded along the alignments, butacross themtoo, which suggests a substantial   amount of planning and preparation took place before the stones were positioned - and that they were selected according to some criteria which we can only now guess at. The next concentration starts again at Kermario 'The Place of the Dead', with the distinctive passage mound between alignments. Again the lines start with the larger stones first (Over 7m high), being graded   down in size as it continues eastwards. The sets of alignments have 'elbows' in them, similar to those seen in theCursus' in England. The nature of these alterations in orientation over their length is a subject of much debate, although it is generally considered to be astronomical this has yet to be fully proven. Changes in the orientation of Egyptian temples were shown by Lockyer to have been caused by re-orientating in order to adjust for the slow movements of the heavens such as that caused by the procession of the equinoxes. The Crucuno Quadrangle is one of a handful in Europe which appear to show a relationship between their latitude and their dimensions. Thom found Crucuno to measure 30 megalithic yards by 40 megalithic yards, creating a 3:4:5 triangle: The Stonehenge station-stones are proportioned according to the second Pythagorean triangle at 12:13:15. The     Lochmariaquer constructions as we see them today have a common     link through Le Grand Menhir, which has now fallen. The tumulus     of Er-Grah (cardinally     orientated) and La Table des Marchands (orientated to the summer solstice)     both show a re-use of existing monuments took place in the area at     around 3,300 BC as they both contain parts of one of the     original menhirs from the Grand Menhir alignment at     Lochmariaquer. This also represents a shift in thinking by the builders     who appear to have built structures at this time which were     predominantly orientated towards the sun instead of the moon. The     Gavr'inis passage mound has revealed several important clues     about the region. The capstone was once a part of a larger     stone, which was probably part of the great 19-stone alignment     at Lochmariaquer (and of which Le Grand menhir Bris We can see in     this particular construction phase that large existing monuments     was re-used for new large-scale constructions in the area, which     also included the alignments, and all the existing monuments at     Lochmariaquer. Within these monuments we can see a shift in     thinking from predominantly lunar orientations to solar. The inside of the Gavr'inis passage mound has one of the richest displays of Neolithic art anywhere in Europe. It has been noticed that there is a similarity between the style of art at Gavr'inis and that in the passage-mounds at theBoyne-Valley complexin Ireland, which were built at the same time and which share a similar orientation. There are several large menhirs in the Carnac area, not least of all is the 20m long menhir called  'Le Grand Menhir Brisï¿½' (The large, broken stone), which now lies in four pieces where it fell. This last remaining stone is only one of an original 19, which appear to have all been taken down and re-used elsewhere in the area at around 3,300 BC. In the 1980's, archaeologists determined that the capstones from Gavrinis, La Table des Marchands and Er grah, were all part of the same stone, and one of the missing 18. There is speculation that the other 17 stones may still be one day located (perhaps also in pieces), and also having been re-used for other constructions in the area. There are still several visible stone circles in the area, including two partially submerged circles on the small island ofEr Lannic, just besideGavrinis. It is now believed that there was once a circle (or Cromleque) at the end of each of the main alignments.  Er-Lannic.(Twin circles) - The twin circles of Er-Lannic are now partially submerged and are only visible momentarily on the boat ride to Gavr'inis passage mound. These circles have been dated to around 3,000 BC, they were found to have several cup-marks, and the outliers (now submerged), suggest an astronomical influence.

Carnac is located at the unique latitude on the Earth at which the solstice sun, both summer and winter, form a perfect Pythagorean triangle relative to the parallel of latitude, that is to the east-west, equinoxial axis of the site.
Carnac is one of the largest megalithic complexes in Europe, and while it is tempting to see the region as a collection of separate sites, it should be recognised that an astronomical connection between sites was established by Thom(2), and that in the Neolithic age the sea level in the areawasroughly 30ft lower than it is todayremoving any physical barrier between sites (such as Gavr'inis and Er-Lannic).
The re-use of megaliths in the area can be used to determine connections between otherwise unrelated sites such as between the passage-mounds of Gavr'inis and La Table des Marchands for example, both of which incorporated pieces of an earlier monument into their structures (capstones) at around 3,100 BC.

"Caral, Peru (Pyramid Complex)",Pyramid Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/perucaral.htm,"Caral Complex, Peru","The Caral-Supe valley was inhabited between roughly 2,600 B.C and 2,000 B.C(1). Caral was described by its excavators as the oldest urban centre in the Americas, a claim that has since been challenged by the discovery of even earlier ancient sites nearby. At 2,600 BC, this is the oldest centre of civilisation in the Americas.A quipu (the knot system used in Andean civilizations to record information) found on the site associates the culture with the later Incas. The cityï¿½s plan and some of its components, including pyramidal structures and residence of the elite, show clear evidence of ceremonial functions and monumental architecture, including six large pyramidal structures.(2) The layout of the city shows signs of it being planned with districts set aside for different trades, for the wealthy and the poor. The 163-acre city was the administrative centre for a complex civilization. The site of Caral and the cluster of 18 similarly dated sites located in the Supe Valley form what is now called the Caral-Supe Civilization. They are important because together they represent the earliest known urban settlements in the Americas, predating the Olmecs by a solid thousand years. The centre of the Caral complex consists of a central public area with six large platform mounds arranged around a huge plaza. The largest of the mounds is 60 feet high and measures 450 x 500 feet at the base. All of these mounds were built within one or two building periods, which suggests a high level of planning, generally associated with state level societies. The public architecture has stairs, rooms, and courtyards; and three sunken plazas suggest society-wide religion. Of the 18 other sites near Caral, ten are more than 60 acres in size; all of them have similar public architecture. Crops included squash, beans, and cotton, grown in the dry desert climate with the assistance of a intricate irrigation system. To erect their structures, they perfected the ""shicra-bag"" technique, by which armies of workers would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in the highlands above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags. With bags acting as landfill, anchoring and reinforcing the structure at each stage, the people of Caral were able to build pyramids up to 70 feet tall. It was the grasses that made these bags which allowed archaeologists to so accurately radio-carbon date the complex. The Inca were known to have used a complicated system of knotted cords of different colours called Quipus. Many of these quipus (also spelled khipus) were destroyed by the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century, but approximately 200 of them dating no earlier than about 650 AD have been found. The recovery of quipu from the civilization of Caral, if the context and dates are correct, suggests several things. First, this is additional evidence that Caral was a likely precursor to the Inca civilization (since the Incas also used quipu). Secondly, quipu as a tradition dates at least 2000 years older than we recognized prior to this point. Thirdly, and most importantly, if quipu were indeed a form of written communication, they are among the earliest forms of writing in the world, only slightly younger than cuneiform, which has been identified at the Mesopotamian site of Uruk approximately 3000 years BC. The Flutes were found between the pyramids within the large sunken amphitheatre, with enough room for hundreds of people during community gatherings. The 32 flutes made of the wing bones of pelicans were tucked into a recess in the main temple. They were played by blowing into the central hole and covering either the left or right hand holes. And, in April 2002, they uncovered 37 cornets of deer and llama bones. ""Clearly, music played an important role in their society,"". The largest platform mound, the 'Piramide Mayor', is 160 x 150 m and 18 m high. It is the largest of six platform structures in the Caral city, all built of quarried stone and river cobbles carried and placed in reed bags. The outer walls were covered with multiple layers of coloured plaster(5) The 'Greater Pyramid', is a strikingly large building located in a dominating position within the urban plan of Caral. It is said that officials standing on the highest part of this pyramid could monitor not only the activities going on the city, but also a large part of the capital area in the middle valley. At the site was found the corpse of a young man who was probably sacrificed in honour to local gods. Archaeologist also discovered walls decorated with small figures and collars made of shark teeth. A 29-foot wide staircase opens into a series of small rooms, which include an atrium and a sacred altar. The altar room has a small hole in the floor, in which offerings were once burned. Huanca means ï¿½standing stoneï¿½, and this impressive monolith stands 2.15 meters in height directly due north of the Huanca pyramid. It is therefore considered to be related to the astronomical and ceremonial aspects of life in Caral. Likewise, it is found across from the main staircase of the important Pyramid of the Huanca. Archaeologists believe that this monolith was used for astronomical and ceremonial purposes. The stone monolith of some 2 meter in height called ""La Huanca"" was uncovered and appears to connect with the adjacent Galeria and Huanca Pyramids.

"Carrowkeel, Ireland",Passage Mounds,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/irelandcarrowkeel.htm,"Carrowkeel, Ireland","There are 14 passage mounds at Carrowkeel, all in different stages of construction. Although the site suffered an explosive assault in the 1911 'digs', there are enough remains to show us that this was once an extremely important part of the Neolithic Irish landscape. The passage mound (Cairn G), was demonstrated by researcher Martin Byrne, to have a 'light-box' which is similar in design to the light-box atNewgrange, and was constructed so as to allow the light of both the the sun and moon to penetrate the inner chamber. (The sun for a month on either side of the summer solstice, and the light of the full moon on either side of the winter solstice) Carrowkeel is a  grouping of 14 cairns/passage mounds, with circumstantial dating placing them at around 3,400-3,100 BC. Unfortunately, much of the site was 'vandalised' in 1911 by R. A. S. Macalister who thoroughly attacked them on behalf of the Royal Irish Academy. He and his assistants employed sledgehammers and high powered explosives in a two week archaeological frenzy. Although the site has 14 cairns and a substantial bronze-age 'village' below it, the complex has been neglected and following the 1911 digs, all that remains today is the ghost of a memory, with only a few cairns left worth visiting. The outstanding views however, from Carrowkeel offer a different view of the landscape in which connections between the prehistoric sites were reinforced by astronomically significant orientations. In particular, in the case of Carrowkeel, the distant hill ofKnocknareaseems to have been of great importance to the builders of these monuments.  The most complete of the Carrowkeel complex, is a classic example of a corbelled, cruciform passage mound, it was built with a large 'portal' stone in front of the passage, with just enough of a gap to allow a person access to the chamber, and with a curious slit like hole in it (most of which is covered today). It is suggested that light reflecting off the mica stones at the back of the chamber might have in turn reflected light back out through the hole, a theory, which if substantiated one day, would make this the only known example of its kind. Martin Byrne is the re-discoverer of both the solar purpose of Cairn G at Carrowkeel on the Summer Solstice sunset and the lunar function of the same cairn which demonstrates that moonlight will enter G and hit the end chamber wall at the extreme Northerly lunar standstill point. The location and orientation of the passage mound was clearly important, and 'capturing the light of the Moon' may have been the main purpose of the construction - as it is orientated to a hill calledKnocknarea, which means ""Hill of the Moon"", which is in-line withthe most northerly point the setting Moon reaches on the horizon, ('lunar standstill'), an event that only happens every 18.6 years (suggesting a long construction or  preparation time). The passage is much shorter than Newgrange, only about two meters long, and so the roof box opens directly into the chamber. This means that the sun can shine into the chamber for a much longer period of time than Newgrange - approximately a month on either side of midsummer, though it only spends about two weeks in the rear of the chamber. Also, even though the sun has been displaced by 1.5 degrees (three solar diameters) to the west, it is impossible for the midsummer sunset to have shone into the end recess of Cairn G. In the photograph below, the sunbeam is shown in its maximum position, centred over the left recess, and this is probably pretty much as it was in ancient times. The full moons rise and set approximately 180 degrees opposite the sun's rising and setting positions. The setting full moons on either side of the winter solstice will illuminate the chamber of Cairn G in much the same fashion as the sun does each summer.  Cairn E- Is a composite of a court cairn and passage cairn. The northern end of Cairn E houses a ruined passage with a cruciform chamber which, like Cairns B, G and K, is aligned toQueen Maeve'sCairn on top ofKnocknarea, on the horizon.

The mound laid out on the summer solstice sunset/winter solstice sunrise axis. Once every 18.6 years at the winter solstice, the full moon will set behind Croghaun, and moonlight may illuminate the left side of the cross-shaped chamber. Then, looking south-west along the axis of the cairn, the winter solstice sun will rise over the court shaped structure. Cairn K-This monument, along with Cairns B and G is the most intact structure at Carrowkeel and is an excellent early example of the classic cruciform corbelled chamber with a capstone 3m above the floor. Up until a few years ago there was a lot of white quartz around the north face and entrance of the cairn. but most has been removed by visitors, probably for souvenirs. This quartz would have been used to cover all of the cairns - seeNewgrangefor an example. And this is probably how the mountains got their name ('Breac Sliabh' means Speckled Mountain), and anyone standing onKnocknareaor any of the peaks of the Ox Mountains would have seen the monuments in Carrowkeel reflecting the light of the sun or moon. TheGavr'inispassage mound in France has a sill stone in the corridor floor with 9 'X's' carved into its face. Only the top halves are present to today, but it is an architectural feature with a symbolism mirrored at several Irish passage mounds both in terms of art and construction.

"Castlerigg, England",Stone Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandcastlerigg.htm,Castlerigg Circle,"The circle is important to archaeo-astronomers who have noted that the sunrise during the Autumn equinox appears over the top of Threlkeld Knott, a hill 3.5 km to the east. Some stones in the circle have been aligned with the midwinter sunrise and various lunar positions. Castlerigg sits onan ancient track from Borrowdale, a source of stone for axes. The ring has a flattened arc at the north-east. It also has an entrance defined by two two tall stones flanking the gap at the exact north.Around the circumference are traces of a bank. Thirty-eight stones are placed in an slightly oval shape of 30m (100ft) in diameter; a further 10 small stones are arranged as a rectangular enclosure on the south-east side of the ring: this is a feature unique to Castlerigg, nothing similar being present in other stone circles. The largest stone of the circle, not far from the enclosure, is 2.5m (8ft 3in) high and it weighs about 16 tons: most of the others, much smaller, are 1 to 1.5m (3-5ft) high. At the north of the ring is an entrance marked by two slightly bigger stones, and about 90m (295ft) to the south-west, by a stile at the edge of the field, is a single outlying stone, 0.9m (3ft) high. There are many theories about Castlerigg's function. In Professor Alexander Thom's opinion, the circle was an astronomical observatory, while Professor Aubrey Burl wrote thatone of Castlerigg's many functions may have been to act as an emporium connected with the Neolithic stone axe industry in the Langdales.Theclose mountainous source of the tuff used for such tools and the stone axes found at the site support this theory. Probably, Castlerigg had a variety of functions: easily approached from all directions, it was probably used for trading, religious ceremonies, and tribal gathering. The rectangular enclosure was excavated in 1882, and only charcoal was found. No other excavation has taken place, either within the enclosure or outside. The Stone circle at Castle Rigg, Cumbria was one of the most successful that Alexander Thom came across in terms of combining astronomical sight-lines with the geometric construction of the stone circle itself. Thom himself pointed out the remarkable difficulties in trying to find a site where the skyline yielded the exact right properties to match the astronomic requirements and geometry of the circle itself. Although the geometric connections with the landscape are not immediately visible today, it has become clear that the builders were endeavouring to express, control or 'come to terms with something'. In addition, J. Glover made some interesting comments regarding Castle Rigg, namely that the specific placement of certain stones enhanced the shadow-effects caused by the sun at specific times of the year. As the circle was built onto a gentle slope, the largest stone creates a shadow nearly a half-mile long at sunset on midsummer's day.  The site was first brought to public notice in 1725 by the antiquarian William Stukeley, who wrote that the circle wasvery entire, consisting of 50 stones, some very large.But in 1849, in hisGuide to The Lakes,Jonathan Otley reported the present total of stones. Castlerigg, known to local people asDruid's Circle,is also calledKeswick Carles,apparently because of an old legend telling that the stones are petrified men, but in fact for a misunderstanding of William Stukeley's wordCarlesforCastle.William Stukeleyï¿½s account of his visit to Castlerigg was published in hisItinerarium Curiosumin 1776, 11 years after his death. Stukeleyï¿½s visit is important, as it is the earliest written record of the stone circle at Castlerigg: ï¿½for a mile before we came to Keswick, on an eminence in the middle of a great concavity of those rude hills, and not far from the banks of the river Greata, I observed another Celtic work, very intire: it is 100 foot in diameter, and consists of forty stones, some very large. At the east end of it is a grave, made of such other stones, in number about ten: this is placed in the very east point of the circle, and within it: there is not a stone wanting, though some are removed a little out of their first station: they call it the Carsles, and, corruptly I suppose, Castle-rig. There seemed to be another larger circle in the next pasture toward the town. (Stukeley 1969 Vol. II, 48). In the early 20th century, a single outlying stone was erected by a farmer approximately 90m to the south west of Castlerigg. This stone has many linear ï¿½scarsï¿½ along its side from being repeatedly struck by a plough, suggesting that it was once buried below the surface and also why the farmer dug it up. It is not possible to say whether this stone was originally part of the circle, or just a naturally deposited boulder.   ""One of the four alignments defined by the construction lines of the circle reveals the feat of indicating two solar events in the Neolithic calendar at opposite ends of the alignment.; the midsummer setting sun and the Candlemas rising sun. This is made possible by the geometry. Astoundingly, the builders have made use of another natural feature along this alignment. At midsummer's day, the sun appears to set at an angle formed by the large stone of the alignment and the ridge of Latrigg away to the west. The exact point of the sunset appears to ave been marked by one of the mounds on that ridge. If at the time of the sunset, having positioned yourself behind the large stone, you turn around 180ï¿½ to face the Candlemas alignment,  'shadow path' as I have termed it, stretches out before you..."" The Castle Rig alignment runs for about 5miles, and along that line, there are at least ten points of significance: The mound, the first small stone of the circle, the centre point of the circle where a buried stone has been found the group of small stones in the cove, the large stone, its shadow path, the spring, a possible standing stone, a high point on the ridge in the middle distance by Low Rigg, a holy well dedicated to St. John, another high point above this, and a the final; notch formed by a river valley high up on St. Johns common near Little Dod. ","(54.592957, -3.11207)",54.592957,-3.11207,"Thirty-eight stones are placed in an slightly oval shape of 30m (100ft) in diameter; a further 10 small stones are arranged as a rectangular enclosure on the south-east side of the ring: this is a feature unique to Castlerigg, nothing similar being present in other stone circles.
At the north of the ring is an entrance marked by two slightly bigger stones, and about 90m (295ft) to the south-west, by a stile at the edge of the field, is a single outlying stone, 0.9m (3ft) high.
In Professor Alexander Thom's opinion, the circle was an astronomical observatory, while Professor Aubrey Burl wrote thatone of Castlerigg's many functions may have been to act as an emporium connected with the Neolithic stone axe industry in the Langdales.Theclose mountainous source of the tuff used for such tools and the stone axes found at the site support this theory.
The Stone circle at Castle Rigg, Cumbria was one of the most successful that Alexander Thom came across in terms of combining astronomical sight-lines with the geometric construction of the stone circle itself.
Thom himself pointed out the remarkable difficulties in trying to find a site where the skyline yielded the exact right properties to match the astronomic requirements and geometry of the circle itself.
As the circle was built onto a gentle slope, the largest stone creates a shadow nearly a half-mile long at sunset on midsummer's day.
Stukeleyï¿½s visit is important, as it is the earliest written record of the stone circle at Castlerigg: ï¿½for a mile before we came to Keswick, on an eminence in the middle of a great concavity of those rude hills, and not far from the banks of the river Greata, I observed another Celtic work, very intire: it is 100 foot in diameter, and consists of forty stones, some very large.

"Castleruddery, Ireland",Henge-Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/irelandcastleruddery.htm,"Castleruddery, Ireland","Originally 40 stones, only 29 now remain, there are several smaller stones lying next to the circle, which show the original preparatory cut-marks of the masons. Castleruddery is a beautiful small Henge-circle (100ft, 30m diameter), with two huge 15-ton, white-quartz portal-stones, which appear either fallen or 'recumbent'. The circle is the same diameter asStonehengeIII in Salisbury. The site has a curious air to it, because of the proportionately large number of stones for such a small circle which appear tolinethe inside of an embankment.

The specific selection of such large stones suggests a function or symbolism seen at several other megaliths.  Of particular interest at the site are the several excellent examples of prehistoric masonry-marks at the site, which shows how stones were prepared for splitting, providing us with a valuable source of evidence. It is interesting to see that the Neolithic stone-masons here used  exactly the same techniques as those found around the ancient world. This means of cutting hard stone can be seen all around the ancient world, from Europe to Egypt and even south America. This is just one of many 'signature' construction techniques adopted by the megalithic builders. At Castleruddery, it is possible  to see several different styles and stages of stone cutting. The several half-finished stones lying abandoned beside the circle leave one with the impression that the site may have been used as a stone-cutters workshop, or that it was left abandoned halfway through works. The remaining stones are surprisingly small - too small for the stone circle itself, leaving one wondering what their use might have been. One stone even has sets on two sides as though ready to split the stone into the size of a breeze block - when it would have been surely easier to use a smaller stone. The plaque at the sitesuggestsan age of approximately 2,500 BC, but it is likely that this estimate will be determined one day to be older (personal opinion).

"Çatal Huyuk, Turkey",City Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/turkeycatalhuyuk.htm,"Catal Hoyuk, Turkey","The site was first identified in 1958 by J. Mellart, and excavations revealed a complex of interconnected 'mud-brick and plaster dwellings' Collins says of it: 'The magnificence of its art, tools, weapon and skilfully fashioned jewellery showed a level of technology and sophistication which has forced archaeologists to review completely their understanding of the development of civilisation'(2) The use of two feline figures in the image (right), is a common feature in many later middle-eastern and European sculpture, in which they invariably represent 'guardians' at places of power, such as on either side of  thrones, or at important entrances and gateways such as at Boghazkoy and Alaja Huyuk, (see photo's below), also both in Turkey. In early Egyptian myth the earth god Aker, (who was the divine god of the eastern and western  horizons or the entrance and exit to the underworld), was represented in hieroglyphs as two lions sitting back to back. It is perhaps relevant that two lions are also used in portrayals of the legendary ante-deluvian Sumerian hero/king, Gilgamesh, creating a direct link between Pre-Sumerian, Sumerian and Post-Sumerian (Mesopotamian) cultural themes. The significance of the discovery of an such an early mother-earth figure, flanked by felines, combines to enforce the idea of an prehistoric matriarchal society, of which influences may also be seen inMalta, where the mother-earth figure is given similar such reverence at approximately the same time in history.  Other artefacts include a polished obsidian mirror, drilled stone beads (including obsidian), and decorated skulls. It appears thatmetallurgywas also practiced here at an early time, as the existence of smelted copper, lead, and metals, are attested at ï¿½hatal Hï¿½yï¿½k since level IX, c 6,400 BC.(2)Mellaart said: 'To our great surprise we found pottery in every building-level right down to level XIII, so that no pre-pottery phases have yet been reached. This makes the ï¿½atal Hï¿½yï¿½k pottery the earliest in the near east, as level XII must probably be dated to about  6,800 BC (+/- 100 years)'.(3) Clay stamp-seals: James Mellaart said of the baked clay seals: 'Whereas the earliest are round and small in size (level VI), the later examples are large and show a variety of shapes, including that of a human hand. They are decorated with fine geometric ornament in a pseudo-meander style.  Ground stone toolsfound at ï¿½atal hï¿½yï¿½k include axe heads, mace heads, querns for grinding grain, ornaments such as pendants, and mirrors of obsidian. These artefacts were made by pecking - slowly crushing away the surface by tapping with another rock, then grinding - wearing away the surface by abrading it with or against another rock, and then sometimes finishing by polishing - grinding using fine sand or silt and water.   The mural paintingsat ï¿½atal hï¿½yï¿½k are the oldest in the world on human built structures. The most spectacular murals found so far at ï¿½atal hï¿½yï¿½k are those from building F.V.1, which portray a variety of animals and human figures. These murals are on all four inside walls of the building but probably represent more than one composition or scene. The people seem to be interacting with the animals, pulling tongues, pulling tails, jumping on their backs. The animals shown have been identified as bulls, horses, stag deer, bear and wild boar, all of which are large and powerful and potentially dangerous to humans. Some of the acts shown appear to be things a person could never actually do with these animals.   These five bone rings (x1 - x5), had been cut from a single bone and were found on the left hand of juvenile skeleton 2119, burial 200...in the east-central platform of Building 1. Although they appear quite large, the hole is small, suitable only for a fairly small hand, and there is little doubt from the wear evidence that they were worn in life by juvenile 2119, who was buried with everyday rings on the left hand.  ""This figurine depicts a seated figure and   was hailed as a typical Catal hoyuk 'Mother Goddess'. In fact it is   unusual in a number of ways... it's one of the smallest   ever found at the site... although this figure has a   bulging stomach, it has no breasts... this figure has a hole in   the top of the body for the attachment of a head, which is   missing. The figurine is complete and undamaged."" Some of the anthropomorphic figurines have removable heads, in similarity to the headless figures in the wall paintings.(5)It is worth noting in relation to this that the bodies of the dead inhabitants ofï¿½atal hï¿½yï¿½kwere often decapitated. Several of the female-goddess figurines onMaltaalso show this same design feature.  Vulture worship -In many of the shrines the walls were adorned with enormous skeletal representations of vultures.Human breasts were found moulded on the walls from plaster, behind which were found actual vulture skulls with their beaks protruding to form the nipples. The emulation of the vultures can be interpreted in terms of an association with the death process. The elaborate decoration of the shrines suggests the presence of a 'priesthood', and presumably, some concept of an afterlife. Note: The Vulture is often portrayed in Egyptian hieroglyphs as carrying the 'Ba' or 'soul', (left), perhaps justifying Collins theory of an association between the prehistoric people of the Anatolian highlands and the 'Elder-Gods', spoken of in Egyptian mythology Evidence from recent (1999) examination of human remains at the site indicate that excarnation (removal of flesh after death as a result of vultures etc). was not carried out as once thought.(5)  Bull Worship- The discovery of evidence of 'Bull veneration' at this early time in prehistory is not uncommon. The same theme is repeated in  art from prehistoric    Crete,France,EnglandandEgypt(amongst others), and the veneration of bulls is still practiced in countries such asIndiaandSpain. Cattle clearly played an important role in prehistoric affairs and cattle bones have been found at many European megalithic structures. The palace of Knossos on Crete, had similar horns and murals as those found atï¿½atal Hï¿½yï¿½k, making it tempting to suggest a connection, as is the discovery ofcattle-veneration inEgypt, which was predictably carried to the extreme; For example, at theSaqqaracomplex where the bull frieze (below, left) came from, an early dynastic tomb was discovered containing  500 mummified cattle, and one of the most important gods of the Egyptian patheon was the (pre-dynastic) cow-Goddess Hathor ('Hat'-'Hor' - 'House of Horus'), who symbolised fertility, motherhood, and was the sky goddess, who's four legs were envisioned straddling the earth marking the cardinal points.  Velikovsky suggested that the origin of prehistoric bull-veneration was related to the arrival of the planet Venus, which he believed was witnessed, and from whence came the apparent universal calendar change from 360 days to 365 days. The discovery of such obvious evidence of cattle-worship from before the time he predicted, is not in favour with this theory. Such an early date does tie in nicely with another theory however, as it accords nicely with the motions of the 'Platonic year'. T It is perhaps worth noting, in relation to this theme, the discovery of a marble figurine of a kneeling/sitting 'twin-goddess', as well as a scene on the wall of a shrine showing twin goddesses with two heads, two bodies but a single pair of legs.(3) ","(37.6664372, 32.8256599)",37.6664372,32.8256599,"Mellart, and excavations revealed a complex of interconnected 'mud-brick and plaster dwellings' Collins says of it: 'The magnificence of its art, tools, weapon and skilfully fashioned jewellery showed a level of technology and sophistication which has forced archaeologists to review completely their understanding of the development of civilisation'(2) The use of two feline figures in the image (right), is a common feature in many later middle-eastern and European sculpture, in which they invariably represent 'guardians' at places of power, such as on either side of  thrones, or at important entrances and gateways such as at Boghazkoy and Alaja Huyuk, (see photo's below), also both in Turkey.

"Çayönü, Turkey",Cult Buildings,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/turkeycayonu.htm,"Cayonu, Turkey","The site provided the archaeological world with several 'first's' including animal husbandry, woven cloth, smelted copper Terrazzo (stone pieces pressed into a cement base) floors and several female figurines among the finds representing some of the earliest traces of the Mother Goddess cult in the region. At 7,000 BC and earlier,    ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½presents certain discoveries that have forced us to rethink our prehistoric past. The site contains a large number of rectangularstonebuildings, laid out in a grid-plan formation, as atNevali Cori. Many of the buildings show evidence of having had special functions, for example, the 'Flagstone' building has a floor made entirely from large flagstones into which weresetmegalithic stones (further standing stones were also set in rows nearby), giving it the appearance of theValley temple,Giza.(1) The   area of the settlement consists of an occupation mound 200 meters in   diameter. There are five to six occupation levels that have been   discovered over the 600 years of occupation with the earliest even   pre-farming. The earliest levels do not include buildings, only   cooking pits. The second layer has a grill like foundation with pebble   pavement, parallel walls which probably supported wooden beams and   plaster-like floors. The third level had 9 x 10 meter buildings that   had terrazzo floors and homes constructed of white limestone cobbles   and crushed rock. This level also had a number of decorative   ornamentations included in the design. The fourth occupation level had   stone foundations and formed cell-like units with walls built of mud.   The final levels consisted of residential buildings arranged in a   rectangular fashion with a number of the buildings housing larger   rooms possibly used for public functions. It is believed that the   total population was between 100 and 200 people and the community   consisted of twenty-five to fifty buildings. The overall layout of the   villageï¿½s design showed a square in the center of the town with   rectangular shaped buildings and housing surrounding it. The majority   of the houses have the upper level built with mud bricks and the lower   level made out of stones. Some floors were made of plastered clay   while others were terrazzo floors. In addition to the buildings, there   are also indications that Cayonu had a number of storage facilities probably used for grains. A deep cylindrical hole with remains of clay and a domed structure was also discovered at this site and was more than likely used for storage of various products.(2) Mehmet ï¿½zdogan:'In ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½ from the earliest monumental buildings, or special buildings it is clear that they were doing something with some kind of liquid. As for the earliest one, the Flagstone Building, it is certain that the floor was polished and even in order to get some kind of flooding, and also in the Sandstone Building there was a water channel going through it, and the Terrazzo Building also had a kind of channel drainage. So was it blood, or water or wine? It is difficult to say, but considering the presence of the Skull Building it seems more the nastier end of the story than the nicer end. Also in ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½, we had in one building these parts of a burial ï¿½ not a complete skeleton ï¿½ intentionally put in a clay coffin above the ground, with some tools associated. It was the strangest grave we got and it must have had something to do with the function of that building'.(3)  The 'Skull' building- This structure was 7m x 7.9m in size and has a round asp at one end. In two small ante-chambers, archaeologists unearthed roughly 70 skulls, a figure which was brought up to 295 eventually. A large chamber was also discovered that contained a one-ton cut and polished stone block, which, along with the discovery of a large flint knife makes it almost certain that the stone acted as an 'offering table'. 'Microscopic analysis of the alter stone's smooth surface revealed a high residue of blood that was found to come from Aurochs, Sheep andHuman beings. There can be little doubt what this implies. The Skull building was not only used for strange ancestral rites but also human sacrifice'(1)  Article:Anthropologists have extracted the blood of humans, sheep and an extinct form of cattle from the surface of a stone slab at an approximately 10,000-year-old agricultural village in Turkey. Analysis of haemoglobin in the samples leaves them with intriguing clues and questions about the ritual activities of early farmers. The polished slab lies among the remains of a structure known as the ï¿½skull building,ï¿½ which contains more than 90 human skulls and several complete and partial human skeletons. ï¿½We donï¿½t know exactly what was going on in the skull building, but human and animal blood was abundant on the slab,ï¿½ says Andree R. Wood of the University of Chicagoï¿½s Oriental Institute. ï¿½It reinforces an argument for at least its occasional use for the cutting up of humans as well as of animals.ï¿½Human sacrifice is one possibility, or human bodies may have been carted to the building after death and placed on the slab for some type of pre-burial ritual. The skulls show no evidence of decapitation. Blood from the slab, dated with an advanced technique called accelerator mass spectroscopy radiocarbon dating (SN: 12/16/89, p. 388), is about 9,000 years old, say Wood and Thomas H. Loy of the Australian National University in Canberra. Initial work at the slab identified human and sheep blood, as well as the blood of an unknown, nonhuman species. The team later obtained blood from bone fragments of an extinct cattle species unearthed at the site and found that its haemoglobin crystals matched those of the unknown species taken from the slab. This is the first identification of the blood of an extinct species, they say. After analyzing the blood, the researchers excavated from the building a number of skulls and horns belonging to the extinct cattle. They also uncovered a large flint knife whose blade held traces of cattle and human blood. Wood says it may have been used in human sacrifices or mortuary rituals, but she notes that toolmakersï¿½ blood often ends up on sharp tools as a result of accidental cuts. Ritual activity at Cayonu remains largely a mystery, says Robert J. Braidwood of the Oriental Institute. Nonetheless, he says, the cultural complexity hinted at by the skull building and other structures at the site strengthens his ï¿½gut feelingï¿½ that humans crossed the threshold to a village-farming life more than 10,000 years ago'.  The discovery of woven cloth-ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½was also the site of the earliest known of piece of cloth, 'which was found still wrapped around an antler...it is 9,000 years old and it thought to be a linen fabric, woven from locally grown flax. (1) 'Archaeologists excavating [the   site] in 1988 found a puzzling, calcium-encrusted piece of material   clinging to what was probably the handle of a bone tool. Microscopic   analysis of the find, which measures about 3 inches by 1.5 inches, now   identifies it as the earliest known fragment of cloth, scientists   announced last week'. 'Several radiocarbon dates   obtained from artifacts found near the cloth place it at around 9,000   years old. Previously, the oldest examples of prehistoric cloth --   ranging from 8,000 to 8,500 years old -- came from another Turkish   site and an Israeli cave'. ""The uses of textiles are   innumerable, and it's hard to say how the Cayonu people employed   cloth,"" says Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood of the National Museum of   Ethnology in Leiden, the Netherlands. Vogelsang-Eastwood, one of the   few archaeologists who specialize in the study of ancient textiles,   identified the Cayonu find as cloth.She suspects the fabric served as   a grip for the bone handle, which was fashioned out of an antler. 'It was not clear whether flax was domesticated originally for its oil-bearing seeds, the source of linseed oil, or for its fibrous stem, or if people had both uses in mind from the start. To recover linen fibers from the stem of the flax the people at Cayonu would have had to soak it in a river or pond. This leaves the flax supple and golden blond, which Dr. Barber points out is the origin of the poetic image of ""flaxen hair."" In this state, the fibers can be separated and twisted into a kind of rough thread. As far as archeologists can tell, the people at Cayonu were already using cloth for clothing, for bags to carry food and perhaps for covering the dead. Dr. Vogelsang-Eastwood speculated that the excavated piece might have been used as a rag to get a better grip on the antler handle. Dr. Hole, though, said it was more likely that it was the preserved piece of the cloth bag that had held the antler. Pottery and figurines have been the best sources of knowledge about early clothing. The oldest known figurines, about 20,000 years old and found in Eastern Europe and Russia, showed early human hunters dressed in hooded garments made of animal skins. The so-called Venus statuettes of that period show women in skimpy skirts of twisted cords, which they might have slipped into to welcome their men home from the hunt. About 7,500 years ago, images on pottery show people wearing more substantial cloth skirts, but with nothing above the waist. There is no firm evidence of people wearing fitted clothes until the Iron Age, in the first millennium BC'.  Metallurgy- ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½    is believed to have been the main bead producing centre during the early-Neolithic period. Archaeologists discovered four early copper items atï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½, dated at 7,200 BC - two pins, one bent fish-hook and a reamer or awl - showing that its inhabitants were already proficient at this time.ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½is the location of the earliest known hammered copper objects, (craftsmen produced oval-shaped copper beads) and smelted copper and bronze objects for at least 7,000 years. A number of artifacts of great value have been unearthed at Cayonu including stone tools of flint and obsidian along with copper pins which indicate evidence of the earliest know use of metal tools. Also, hammered native copper has also been discovered in conjunction with other artifacts. Clay pottery has been found including stone vessels and two small clay models of houses. Impressed or incised bone pieces have also been found which may be indications of art, numerical counters or an early experiment in writing.

Previously, the oldest examples of prehistoric cloth --   ranging from 8,000 to 8,500 years old -- came from another Turkish   site and an Israeli cave'.
""The uses of textiles are   innumerable, and it's hard to say how the Cayonu people employed   cloth,"" says Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood of the National Museum of   Ethnology in Leiden, the Netherlands.
Vogelsang-Eastwood, one of the   few archaeologists who specialize in the study of ancient textiles,   identified the Cayonu find as cloth.She suspects the fabric served as   a grip for the bone handle, which was fashioned out of an antler.
The oldest known figurines, about 20,000 years old and found in Eastern Europe and Russia, showed early human hunters dressed in hooded garments made of animal skins.
About 7,500 years ago, images on pottery show people wearing more substantial cloth skirts, but with nothing above the waist.
Archaeologists discovered four early copper items atï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½, dated at 7,200 BC - two pins, one bent fish-hook and a reamer or awl - showing that its inhabitants were already proficient at this time.ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½is the location of the earliest known hammered copper objects, (craftsmen produced oval-shaped copper beads) and smelted copper and bronze objects for at least 7,000 years.
A number of artifacts of great value have been unearthed at Cayonu including stone tools of flint and obsidian along with copper pins which indicate evidence of the earliest know use of metal tools.",Turkey,Asia
"Cerne Abbas, England",Chalk Figure,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandcerneabbas.htm,The Cerne Abbas Giant,"This huge and impressive giant figure is formed by a trench 0.3m (1ft) wide and the same depth, cut into the underlying chalk. He is 55m (180ft) long and 51m (167ft) wide, and his right hand holds an enormous knobbed club 36.5m (120ft) long. His most famous and prominent feature is the erect phallus and testicles which indicate that fertility rites were practised here. This is supported by the fact that until recently, on 1 May maypole dancing and other celebration were held in the Iron-Age earth enclosure known as theFrying Pansituated a little further up the hill, above the giant's left arm.    The first reference to this figure dates back to 1694: a payment in the Cerne Abbas churchwarden's accounts of 3 shillings towards the re-cutting of the giant. The first written reference is by John Hutchins in hisGuide to Dorset,1751, but no one knows exactly when or who first cut the Giant. Recently, the historian Ronald Hutton stated that it was cut in the 17th century by the Lord Holles' servants. In fact, it's unusual that, unlike the Uffington White Horse, there is no reference to the Cerne Abbas Giant in Medieval documents. During the Civil War (1644 - 1660), Lord Holles was Lord of the Manor but his estate was sequestered and mismanaged by his steward. Maybe then his servants, in this period of chaos, cut the giant in the hillside. A local legend says that a real giant was killed on the hill and that the people from Cerne Abbas drew round the figure and marked him out on the hillside. Barren women were said to conceive soon after sleeping on the Giant's body, while young women wishing to keep their lovers faithful would walk around the figure three times. Another story ascribes the figure to the monks from the nearby abbey, who cut it as a joke against their abbot. The figure is kept free from grass by ascouringevery seven years. In 2008, a group of archaeologists using special equipment found that part of the carving had been allowed to be obliterated.(1)According to these findings, the free arm should have held a depiction of an animal's skin, giving credence to the theory that the giant was a depiction of a hunter, or alternatively, Heracles with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm.  The giant is generally considered to represent the god Helith or Hercules, and recent surveys suggest that the figure was cut at the end of the second century AD when the Emperor Commodus (who believed he was a reincarnation of Hercules) revived the worship of this god. If the Cerne Giant is of any great age, then he probably represents an ancient god; one suggestion is he could be theCeltic god Nodens, who was worshipped by the Durotrige tribe who lived in Dorset before the arrival of the Romans in AD 43. The support for this idea comes from a bronze handle, found when land on a Celtic fort site near Blandford Forum was ploughed up. Archaeologists decided that the handle was Celtic, and that the figure of a naked man depicted on it was Nodens; the Giant on the hill at Cerne Abbas shows a marked relationship in the style of drawing.(1) Another contender is the Roman godHercules. In 1764 William Stukely wrote that people in the area called the Giant ""Helis"". Another writer stated that up until the 6th century, the god Helis was worshipped. Helith and Helis may be bastardisations of the ancient version of the name for Hercules - Hetethkin. The Giant can also be compared with representations of Hercules found in other parts of the country, indicating that the figure dates from the 2nd century at the latest. THE CERNE ABBAS giant, a naked relic of ancient British heritage, may once have worn a cloak over his shoulder and carried a severed head in his left hand. New studies of the soil around the giant have found disturbances which suggest that the figure has changed considerably since it was cut into the chalk of a Dorset hillside about 2,000 years ago. Evidence of soil disturbance suggests that the figure may have had additional features which have been lost. A small knoll, some 40cms high, under the left hand could once have been a representation of a severed head. A severed head would fit with an Iron Age god, a guardian of the tribe returning from battle with the head of an enemy. The figure is in the centre of territory once occupied by a tribe called the Durotriges, an area which is roughly equivalent to present day Dorset. There is an ancient holy well near by. The Celts were keen on sacred springs and so it is an obvious place to create an image of a guardian God. There are many examples from the Romano-British period of naked warriors carrying a club and a severed head, including a coin minted in the days of King Cymbeline. The studies have not only raised new questions about the giant, they have also settled some old controversies. During Victorian times the giant's penis became discreetly veiled by the natural growth of shrubbery. Scholars believe that when the penis was subsequently re-excavated it was extended by some two and a half metres. This has now been confirmed. 'Since Victorian times, the 180ft Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset has been said to cure childlessness and bless women with improved fertility. Now the women in the surrounding towns and villages have the highest birth rates in the country. The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show that the women of North Dorset have on average three children each ï¿½ nearly double the national average and nearly three times as much as the city dwellers of Westminster'.

"Chaco canyon, New Mexico",Anasazi Sun-dagger,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicochaco.htm,"Chaco canyon, Mexico","Rising nearly 400 feet above the desert floor in a remote section of ancient Anasazi territory named Chaco Canyon stands an imposing natural structure calledFajada Butte. Along a narrow ledge near the top of the butte is a sacred Native American site given the nameSun Daggerthat a thousand years ago revealed the changing seasons to the Anasazi astronomers. After they abandoned the canyon for unknown reasons 700 years ago the sun dagger's secret remained hidden except to a special few. In 1977 it was inadvertently ""rediscovered"" when known or suspected rock art and petroglyphs on the butte were being studied and catalogued. In what is now the state of New Mexico in the south-western United States, in an area known as Chaco Canyon, are the remains of an elaborate development of the Anasazi people who lived in the region from about 500 to 1300 AD. Some 120 meters (400 feet) above the canyon floor near the top of an outcropping known as Fajada Butte, three slabs of sandstone are leaning against a rock wall creating a shaded space. Carved into this shaded wall are two spiral petroglyphs, one large and one small. Sunlight passes over them at various times throughout the year as it streams through chinks between the sandstone, but it was not until the 1970s that their true purpose was literally illumined. On the summer solstice, a single sliver of sunlightï¿½which she dubbed a ""Sun dagger""ï¿½appeared near the top of the larger spiral and over a period of 18 minutes ""sliced"" its way down through the very center, cutting the spiral in half before leaving it in shadow once again. On the winter solstice, two daggers of light appeared for 49 minutes, during which they exactly framed the large spiral. Finally, an equally fascinating and more complex light show occurred on the spring and autumnequinoxes. The large spiral is carved in such a way that, counting from the center outward to the right, there are nine grooves. On each equinox a dagger of light appeared that cut through the large spiralï¿½not through its center but exactly between the fourth and fifth grooves from the centre. In other words, it cut exactly halfway between the centre and the outer edge of the spiral, just as the equinoxes cut the time between the solstices exactly in half. Meanwhile, a second dagger sliced through the centre of the small spiral. These ""light shows,"" which presumably had been going on for centuries, continued for several years after their rediscovery. However, in 1989 it was found that the granite slabs had shifted. The alignments that had apparently been arranged so carefully by the Anasazi were no more. Similar light displays marking the solstices and/or equinoxes can be found at other locations in the southwestern United States and Mexico. In another Anasazi ruin in Hovenweep National Monument near the borders of Utah and Colorado, light beams also illuminate spiral petroglyphs on the summer solstice. At Burro Flats in Southern California, a winter solstice Sun points a finger of light to the center of five concentric rings in an early Chumash rock art display. In a Tipai shrine known as La Rumorosa in Baja California on the western coast of Mexico, a dramatic display can be witnessed on the winter solstice when a ""dagger"" of light appears to shine from the eyes of a figure painted on a shaded rock wall.(1), (2) Lunar observations. The three slabs stand on the sloping ledge at the foot of the cliff, each contacting the cliff over only a small area . On the left of slab three is a supporting buttress of smaller rocks and under the right edge of slab one is a small supporting rock. All the slabs and rocks of the assembly consist of the same soft sandstone as the cliff itself. The slabs are roughly rectangular (2 to 3 m high, 0.7 to 1 m wide, and 20 to 50 cm thick) and weigh about 2000 kilograms each. The outer surfaces and tops are rounded and weathered, the inner surfaces smooth and gently curved with sharp edges. By comparing the matching details on the facing surfaces of the slabs, it has been determined that these slabs once fitted together to form one block. The place where this block was joined to the cliff face was found by noting the strata and bedding planes and the curvature of the cliff face).By such comparison, the original location of each slab was found to within 1 cm, well to the left of the present locations. Several pieces of evidence rule against the slabs' having fallen into their present positions naturally. First, the slabs would have had to move 2 m and more horizontally while the centre of gravity of the three together fell only about 80 cm vertically. In particular, the centre of slab three by itself is now only 30 cm lower than when it was attached to the cliff. Second, there are no impact marks, either on the cliff face or on the inner edges of the slabs, to suggest a collision. Third, the cliff face above the original location of the slabs shows that another rock mass had broken away from there. This higher rock could not have broken off before the slabs did. Had it broken off with (or after) the slabs, it would have prevented them from falling naturally to their present location. There is no evidence today of this rock mass. Indeed the absence of rubble near the slabs is unusual on the butte, where fallen rock is found below other such cliffs. Fourth, the slabs are set firmly in place on a rocky ledge and are partially supported by buttressing stones. We conclude that moving and setting the slabs in their present position involved deliberate human intervention.  Several factors show that the Anasazi inhabitants of Chaco developed the construct between A.D. 900 and 1300 (the approximate date of Pueblo abandonment of the canyon) and indicate that the specific time was between A.D. 950 and 1150, the period of greatest population and development in the canyon. Certain rock art sites of the ancient Pueblos are reported to mark solar positions by the placement of designs to receive shadow and light formation at the rising and setting of the sun at solstice or equinox, and one such site includes a spiral design. Two petroglyph sites on Fajada Butte are marked with shadow and light changes at the time of solar noon at summer solstice, and one of these includes a spiral design. The spiral is frequently found in association with ancient Pueblo petroglyphs of sun imagery. It is identified with the Anasazi rock art style prior to A.D. 1300. Examples of architecture of the same period have openings that channel light so that it shines on key features of the structures such as doorways, niches, and corners at the solstices and equinoxes The site's nine ""great houses,"" the largest of   which stood five stories high and had 650 dwelling rooms and 37   ceremonial kivas, along with some 3,500 smaller structures in and   around the canyon, may have housed up to 10,000 people at a time.   Chaco was the hub of a network of roads-at least 20 of them, each   nearly 30 feet wide-that radiated in all directions for distances of   up to 100 miles, suggesting that the site may have been a part-time   home to pilgrims from other Anasazi settlements who came here for   religious ceremonies, trade, or both. A new study of the Southwestern landscape has revealed that three of the region's largest and most important ancient centers were linked by a 450-mile meridian line - Chaco Canyon, in New Mexico; Aztec Ruins, 55 miles due north near the Colorado state line; and Casas Grandes, 390 miles due south in Chihuahua, Mexico. Chaco and Aztec were also connected along the meridian by a road known today as the Great North Road (see ARCHAEOLOGY, January/February 1994).

"Chankillo, Peru (Landscape Observatory)",Landscape Observatory,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/peruchankillo.htm,"Chankillo, Peru","The Thirteen Towers of Chankillo run north to south along a low ridge within a fourth-century B.C. ceremonial complex in north coastal Peru. From evident observing points within the adjacent buildings to the west and east, they formed an artificial toothed horizon that spanned the annual rising and setting arcs of the Sun.(1) Chankillo was a ceremonial centre and solar observatory located within an area of rock outcrops and sand ramps in the Casma-Sechin river valley of arid coastal Peru. Based on a combination of AMSradiocarbon dates anddendrochronological principles from wooden room lintels, the site was constructed between about 2,000 and 2,350 years ago. Recent archaeoastronomical investigations suggest that the site was partly created to observe the movement of the sun through the solar year, from solstice to solstice. It can be seen on the photo below that all the buildings of the complex show an orientation towards the direction of the December solstice sunrise. Structures at Chankillo include a 'fortified' temple, a ceremonial-civic area with buildings, a plaza, and storage facilities, and several smaller scattered buildings, within an area of about 4 square kilometres. A 300 meter long hilltop structure with massive walls, restricted gates and parapets is one of the most important component of Chankillo. Artefacts associated with the buildings and plazas suggest a ceremonial function with recurring feasts at Chankillo. Ceramic panpipes, warrior figurines, serving vessels, and abundant maize and shellfish remains have been found as has rooms built to store corn beer. The ceremonial plaza was clearly intended for large groups of people, while the small viewing platforms were reserved for one or two elite individuals. Chankillo's main astronomical feature is a line of thirteen cubic stone blocks, called the 'Thirteen Towers', arranged along the ridge of a low hill. The line runs due north/south, but the southern-most towers are slightly skewed to the southwest. The rectangular structures vary in size, from 75 to 125 meters square and 2-6 meters in height, but they are regularly spaced at intervals between 4.7-5.1 m forming a 'toothed' horizon. Each tower has a pair of inset staircases leading to the summits. Excavation of the   buildings to the west of the towers revealed one corridor that was   clearly an observation point for watching the sun rise over the   toothed horizon. The end of the corridor was littered with offerings   of pottery, shell, and stone artefacts not found elsewhere nearby,   indicating significant rituals associated with solar observations. A   building to the east is in the exact mirror position of the western   observation point, and is lined up to view the sunsets over the 13   towers. The first problem is that despite being on a hill, Chankillo does not command the high ground. The hilltop is northwest of the fort, which would have allowed an invading army to rain sling stones onto defenders manning the fortress's outer walls with little fear of counterattack. Second, the fort has no source of water or place to store food during a siege. As if that isn't enough, the outer wall has five gates to defend, and the second and third walls each have four gates. Rather than putting these entrances in places where the terrain is steep or difficult to cross, they are located where it is easiest to walk or run up the hillside.(2) ","(-9.563515599999999, -78.22767759999999)",-9.563515599999999,-78.22767759999999,"The Thirteen Towers of Chankillo run north to south along a low ridge within a fourth-century B.C. ceremonial complex in north coastal Peru.

"Chauvet, France",Palaeolithic Cave,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/francechauvet.htm,"Chauvet cave, France","Discovered in 1994 in the valley near France's Ardeche River, the Chauvet Cave contains the oldest such paintings on record (some of them 32,000 years old), almost perfectly preserved when collapsing rocks sealed off the entrance some 25,000 years ago. The art is the oldest recorded cave-art in the world and is surprisingly extensive, highly varied, and very skilfully executed, it includes species now extinct such as the Megaceros (Right). Based on radiocarbon dating, the cave appears to have been occupied by humans during two distinct periods: the Aurignacian and theGravettian. Most of the artwork dates to the earlier, Aurignacian, era (30,000 to 32,000 years ago). The later Gravettian occupation, which occurred 25,000 to 27,000 years ago, left little but a child's footprints, the charred remains of ancient hearths and carbon smoke stains from torches that lit the caves. Hundreds of animal paintings have been catalogued, depicting at least 13 different species, including some rarely or never found in other ice age paintings. Rather than depicting only the familiar animals of the hunt that predominate in Paleolithic cave art,i.e.horses, cattle, reindeer, etc., the walls of the Chauvet Cave are covered withpredatory animals: lions, panthers, bears, owls, rhinos and hyenas. The fantastical shape of the cave would have made Chauvet a particularly 'sacred' place through Palaeolithic eyes. The theory that such places were used for 'shamanic' purposes is still in its infancy, but do not seem to apply in the case of Chauvet. The vast number of bones with cut marks on them, and the discovery of a child's footprints are more indicative of normal day-to-day living. The appearance of such high quality art at this early time suggests that our understanding of such processes is far from being fully understood. Although Cave-bears are now extinct, they were clearly present when these painting were being done as some of the bear footprints have pigment on them and there are even claw-marks on some of the animal paintings.  The floor of the cave was found with over 150 skeletons of cave-bears in it(2). The significance of the stone above therefore is speculative, but it is suggested that it was placed there deliberately and therefore represents a form of relationship between man and cave-bear. The last and deepest of the Cave chambers, the Salle du Fond, is the home of the Chauvet Venus. From the ceiling of the chamber, which is nearly 7 m [20 feet] high, a vertical cone of limestone hangs down ending in a point 1.10 m [3ft 6 ins] off the floor. It is on this hanging outcrop that the Venus was drawn in black charcoal. The black pubic triangle of the Venus is at eye level and seems to be the heart of the composition. It is shaded in with black pigment. The white vulva slit appears to have been done later with a pointed tool and is clearly indicated by a vertical line incised strongly enough to cut through both the black pigment and the yellow surface film of the rock. The legs, with plump thighs, finish in a point with the feet not shown. This Venus is absolutely classical and her proportions, the stylistic elements, the selection of the anatomical elements shown are all characteristicallyAurignacian or Gravettian, as known from the small Venus statues of Central and Eastern Europe.The Venus is not isolated. Other lines and realistic representations are associated with her, directly on the outcrop. Higher and to the left of the Venus are two felines, a mammoth and a small musk ox. To the right of the Venus is the ""Sorcerer"" or man-bison. The relation of the Venus to the Sorcerer cannot be simply fortuitous. The Venus is the earliest of the designs. The feline on the left, the Sorcerer, and the multiple lines on the right, are all painted or engraved later. Their creation entailed a voluntary and selective local destruction of parts of the body of the Venus, the most obvious spot being at one of the upper extremities of the pubic triangle.Even more surprising is the voluntary absence of any super imposition. Neither the Sorcerer nor the large feline on the left cut across the Venus. The Venus and the composition in which she occupies a privileged place are in a central topographic situation in the Salle du Fond. However, she is paradoxically peripheral in the over all design that seems centred on a beautiful horse lodged in a small chapel like niche to the left in the middle of the main panel ofcave paintings.Perhaps the female representation relates directly to the corridor to the chamber, which opens just behind her. Four other female representations limited to just the pubic triangle are in the cave; they are all in the system including the Galerie des Megaceros and the Salle du Fond, indicating each time the entrance to the adjacent cavities.

"Chichen Itza, Mexico",Citadel,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicochichenitza.htm,"Chichen Itza, Mexico","Chichen Itza is considered by many as one  the most important Mayan complexes in Mexico. It is generally agreed that Chichen Itza was first populated between 500 and 900 AD by Mayans then abandoned around 900, the city was resettled 100 years later and subsequently invaded by Toltecs from the North. There are numerous relief's of both Mayan gods including Chac and the Toltec gods including Quetzacoatl. Natural Sink -holes (Cenotes) -A long, white limestone road orsacbe, extends north from the base of the north staircase of the great pyramid,El Castillo. The road passes theTemple of Venusand continues for a thousand feet to a large, limestone sinkhole the Maya call ""cenote."" This is El Cenote Sagrado, the Sacred Well, found at the northernmost point of the Chichen Itza archaeological zone. This large cenote was likely one of the major reasons why the Maya built such an immense city here. The cenote is fed by an underground river, and supplied water for the city as well as served as a location where the Maya conducted religious rites. Almost perfectly circular, the Chichen Itza cenote is more than 50 meters in diameter, and its upper rim stands more than 20 meters from the waters surface. The water itself is almost 15 meters deep with a thick layer of muck at the bottom that has so far proven too deep to measure, or to allow for easy exploration of its depths. 'In 1894,Edward Thompson, the United States Consul in Merida, purchased the plantation which included the ruins of Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½. Ten years later he dredged the cenote, recovering artifacts of gold, copper, carved jade and pottery, as well more fragile items such as textiles, spears, and rubber containers that held a form of incense. The artifacts are believed to have been thrown in as offerings to the Maya rain godChaak.(Note* Some were determined to have come from as far away as Columbia). Thompson shipped the artifacts to the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. In 1926, the Mexican government demanded the return of the artifacts and tried Thompson on charges of theft. The case went up to the Mexican Supreme Court, which in 1944 found in favor of Thompson. Beginning in 1959, the Peabody Museum gave many of the valuable artifacts but some of it remains on display at Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½ near a plaque in Spanish that condemns to the Mexican government, which displays some of them in Mexico City. Thompson also recovered numerous skeletons, which lends credence to the early Spanish chroniclers who said the cenote was the scene of human sacrifice. It is known that the Toltec influence on the Maya introduced the concept of human sacrifice to Yucatan. Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½ also has a sister cenote called theXtoloc Cenote. Unlike the turgid waters of the Sacred Well, Xtoloc is relatively fresh and pure, prompting the belief that it served as the major water supply for the city while the Cenote Sagrado was reserved for ritual purposes'. There are several other natural 'Cenotes' nearby to Chitchen Itza, stairs leading down the sides of the natural  'sink-holes' and relics discovered inside testify to their importance to the Mayans. The sun creates a shadow of a huge 'snake' to ascend the steps in spring, and descend again in autumn(1). Whether or not this was a deliberate design feature is speculative, but other astronomical features at the site certainly lend weight to the idea that it was intentional.Each step corresponds to a day, each platform to a Mayan month.(17).The architecture of the pyramid encodes precise information regarding the Mayan calendar. Each face of the four-sided structure has a stairway with ninety-one steps, which together with the shared step of the platform at the top, add up to 365, the number of days in a year. These stairways also divide the nine terraces of each side of the pyramid into eighteen segments, representing the eighteen months of the Mayan calendar. The pyramid is also directionally oriented to mark the solstices and equinoxes. The axes that run through the northwest and southwest corners of the pyramid are oriented toward the rising point of the sun at the summer solstice and its setting point at the winter solstice. 'Handclaps evoke chirped echoes from the staircases of the Mayan Pyramid of Kukulkan at Chichen Itza. The physics of the chirped echo can be explained quite simply as periodic reflections from step-faces. What is interesting is that the chirped echo sounds arguably like the primary call of the Mayan sacred bird, the resplendent Quetzal. This magnificent bird, now near extinction, has for thousands of years represented the 'spirit of the Maya'.  The Great Ball Court:Juego de Pelota Principal(Principal Ball Court) is the main one of eight ball courts, and the largest games court in all of Mexico's archaeological sites. Here, you will see the famous 7m-high stone hoops. It is believed that contestants ofpelota(ball) needed to get a rubber ball through them during the game. At least one image of a ball with a skull in it is reported at Chichen Itza. Accoustic Properties of the 'Ball Court': Each end has a raised ""temple"" area. A whisper from end can be heard clearly at the other end 500 feet away and through the length and breath of the court. The sound waves are unaffected by wind direction or time of day/night. Archaeologists engaged in the reconstruction noted that the sound transmission became stronger and clearer as they proceeded. In 1931 Leopold Stokowski spent 4 days at the site to determine the acoustic principals that could be applied to an open-air concert theatre he was designing. Stokowski failed to learn the secret. To this day it has not been explained. The Carocal (Observatory): 'The Temple of a Thousand Pillars': This complex is analogous to Temple B at the Toltec capital ofTula, and indicates some form of cultural contact between the two regions. The one at Chichen Itza, however, was constructed on a larger scale. At the top of the stairway on the pyramidï¿½s summit (and leading towards the entrance of the pyramidï¿½s temple) is a ChacMool. There are several other broken Chacmool around the site. The Ossario:This step-pyramid temple dominates the platform, on a small scale. Like its larger neighbour, El Castillo, it has four sides with staircases on each side. There is a temple on top, but different from El Castillo, at the centre is an opening into the pyramid which leads to a natural cave 12 m. below. Edward H. Thompson excavated this cave in the late 1800s, and because he found artefacts such as jade beads and several skeletons. The same phenomena was reported at bothTeotihuacanand the Great pyramid at Giza. Roughly all sources agree that from approximately 550 AD to 800 AD, Chichen Itza existed mainly as a ceremonial center for the Maya civilization. The area was then largely abandoned for about a hundred years (no one knows reason ), to be resettled around 900 AD again. Shortly before 1000 AD, it was invaded by a people from the north (The Toltecs). Mayan historical sources mention that a man who called himself Kukulkan arrived in Chichen Itza from the west (Kukul means ï¿½featheredï¿½ and kan means ï¿½serpentï¿½) in the period that ended in 987 AD. A strong case has been made that Kukulkan and Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl were most likely the same person, and that he brought the Toltec practices and beliefs to Chichen Itza, including the practice of human sacrifice. Approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) west of the Chichen Itza archaeological zone are a network of sacred caves known as Balankanche (Sp:Gruta de Balankanche). On 15 September 1959, Josï¿½ Humberto Gï¿½mez, a local guide, discovered a false wall in the cave. Behind it he found an extended network of caves with significant quantities of undisturbed archaeological remains, including pottery and stone-carved censers, stone implements and jewelry. INAH converted the cave into an underground museum, and the objects after being catalogued were returned to their original place so visitors can see themin situ.

Creevykeel, adjoining the Sligo-Bundoran road 2.4km (1-1/2 miles) NE of Cliffony, is certainly the most impressive and has been thoroughly restored. The shapes of the pillar stones are unique, as well. Many archaeologists refer to the stones and male and female, the males being the cylindrical pillars; the females being the broader, smoother stones having a diamond like shape Located within a wedge-shaped cairn, this tomb was originally about 61 m (200 ft) long. At the eastern end is the main entrance, through a small passage, which leads into an oval forecourt. Originally paved, the forecourt is very large : 17 x 10 m (56 x 33 ft). Close inspection shows a change in size of the orthostats ending the court, as if they might have been built in more than one phase. Based on the surviving kerbstones it is estimated that the length of the original cairn was approximately 48 meters. Unfortunately the restorers have overdone their job by extending the already impressive cairn with an other 12 meters. During Hencken's excavations of 1935, a chalk ball was discovered at Creevykeel, it is an item similar to those found in Brittany, which may be a further confirmation that court-tombs often slightly pre-date passage-tombs. Other grave goods included Neolithic pottery, leaf-shaped flint arrowheads, hollow scrapers, and polished stone axe-heads.

The museum is located in the Alcazaba, the maurean residence.  These three Dolmen/passage mounds are often ignored in prehistoric European literature, however, their importance is obvious from the sheer size and scale of the stones used for the monuments, with the largest regularly estimated at around 180 Tons Recent research has shown that Menga's anomalous orientation can be explained by an area of specieal significance on the north face of La Pena, at the place known as Matacabras Cave, which has 'schematic-style' prehistoric paintings in it.(Ref: Site pamphlet)  Built on a natural mound, the main chamber is composed of five capstones supported by three squared pillars, cut into the stones that compose the floor. Anthropomorphic scenes are recorded on its walls. When the grave was opened and examined in the 19th century, archaeologists found the skeletons of several hundred people inside The 'anomalous' orientation of the passage mound, facing northeast (azimuth 45ï¿½), to the north of the summer solstice sunrise. In the context of the monument (and other contemporary monuments), appears to be explained by its alignment with the ever-present La Pena.  'About a quarter of a mile to the eastward of the town (Antequera), on the road to Archidona, are three conical hills, from sixty to eighty feet in height, remarkable for the regularity of their outline, and covered with olive trees. On ascending the one nearest the town, and close to its summit, you find yourself opposite the cave. It presents a perfect porch, symmetrical in shape, but composed of rough stones of gigantic magnitude... ...In length, the cave measures seventy-one feet, and lies due east and west; the entrance faces eastward and looks towards the other two similar hills; and beyond them gain, at almost the distance of a league, rises abruptly from the plain the Pena de los Enamorados, which from here, presents its most picturesque appearance.' 'Signor Mitjana [in 1841], in searching for bones, weapons, or other remains, and perhaps, for other chambers deeper in the hill, caused a shaft to be sunk in the interior, between the third pillar and the extremity, but discovered nothing; and to give light to his workmen, broke out at the end a large hole, four or five feet square, which considerably impairs the effect and uniformity of the place'. The entrance to the monument faces the 'Pena de los Namorados' (Lovers Peak). It is reasonably clear that this peak was a primary consideration in the selection of location for the Cueva de Menga complex and this example of deliberate placement confirms the idea that the landscape itself was an important aspect of the Neolithic mind, as was the association between megaliths and 'simulacrum', a suggestion which infers that the rocks and earth were seen as living entities, which would have endowed the site with a special quality.

"Cuicuilco, Mexico",Circular Pyramid,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicocuicuilco.htm,"Cuicuilco Pyramid, Mexico","Cuicuilco is an important early Mesoamerican site which is said to have developed in Central Mexico during the Formative period, between 700 B.C. and A.D. 400, when it was totally destroyed by a volcanic eruption. According to translations of ancient Nahuatl, Cuicuilco is variously interpreted as the 'Place of Power' or the 'Place of the Rainbow' and the 'place where they make songs and dances'. Although the pyramid was discovered in 1920 by archaeologist Manuel Gamio, the first investigations at Cuicuilco were carried out by Byron Cumming, between 1923 and 1924, which led to the discovery of the civic core of the site and the main pyramid. In 1968, during the construction work for a swimming pool for the Olympics, other smaller, rectangular pyramids were discovered. The most important building of Cuicuilco is the circular pyramid made of four platforms and covered in stone, 27 m (ca 90 ft.) high and 80 m (260 ft.) in diameter. A series of superimposed altars were found atop the pyramid. These were painted in red with traces of haematite. Next to the Pyramid of Cuicuilco was discovered and excavated the ancient city of Ticoman. The first stone monument on the Mexican plateau is the pyramid of Cuicuilco, near Mexico City. In fact, it is a truncated cone, with a stone core; the rest is made of sun-dried brick with a stone facing. It shows the main features of the Mexican pyramids as they were developed in later times.(4)  Cumming's dated the pyramid at around 6,000 BC, based on the depth of the Lava Pedigral', which is up to 10m deep in places. Knowing the date of the last eruption, and seeing that there was approximately 3 times more lava below, he concluded that it must be three times older. It is now known that the earlier eruptions occurred over a 500 year period. By 200 BC, Cuicuilco was one of the most important and larger centres in Central Mexico, and it has been estimated that its area covered approximately 400 ha, with a population of 20,000 people. At around 60 BC a first eruption of the volcano Xitli covered most of the centre and its cultivated fields, severely affecting the life of the community. Cuicuilco, however, continued to live as a smaller centre until 400 AD, when a final volcanic eruption definitely buried the site. Radiocarbon dating of the Pyramid was determined by Fergusson and Libby, in 1963. The test for the base of the sediments gave an age of 2,200 years B.P. Radiocarbon dates from below the lava flow date the original construction of the building between 800 and 600 BC.(2)Discovery of a campfire at the base of the building has placed the earliest occupation of the area at 2,000 BC(7) The Cuicuilco pyramid was one of the first true urban centres in the Basin of Mexico. Its construction started a few centuries BC, during the Late Pre-classic period. The pyramid is partially covered by a basaltic lava flow produced by theXitlemonogenetic volcano. New work around the pyramid and the volcano together with new radiocarbon dates indicate that the pyramid and nearby settlements were abandoned as a direct consequence of the volcanic activity ofXitle. The new dates, obtained from material which clearly is contemporaneous with the volcanic activity, suggest that the eruption took place around 1670 years BP, some 300 years later than previously thought.(3) ""He with the navel"" (Xitli), according to the scribe Alva Ixtlilxochitl, ""opened the earth and swept everything in its path, on the day Ahui-Quiahuitl, in the year 8-Tecpatl,"" this translates into April 24 of 76 A.D."" (1)  Archaeology has concluded that Cuicuilco was a prominent community prior to the emergence of Teotihuacan as an urban centre, noting the six small communities which eventually combined to become Teotihuacan were founded and showing evidence of modest growth during the time Cuicuilco was building pyramids and public monuments. The city seems to have been abandoned at around the same time that Teotihuacan entered its main growth phase, following the eruption of the Xitle volcano.The site of Cuicuilco is covered by  dense volcanic lava field known as the Pedegral de San Angel. The lava covers an area of approximately 80km2, including the foothills of the Ajusco mountain range and extending down to the nearby lake shore. A 1956 study concluded that the uneven lave deposits, reaching a depth of over 10m in areas, were a major factor in the preservation of Cuicuilco. The site is also inside a modern urban area, and is partially covered by buildings associated with the National University of Mexico. Only partial archaeological investigation has been possible and modern techniques have damaged the prehistoric city. Several 1990 archaeological finds at Cuicuilco, were destroyed for the construction of a multi-storied office complex. Consequently the true size and complexity of the original site may now be impossible to ascertain.(5)A stela discovered near the pyramid of Cuicuilco is suggested as proof an ancient connection between the Cuicuilco culture and that of the contemporary Olmecs, considered until recently the mother culture of Mesoamerica.(6)Of great surprise to archaeologists was the fact that the entire structure of the pyramid was found to have been covered with a laayer of yellow earth just over 1metre thick, suggesting that the settlers had known in advance of the eruption and had attempted to preserve the building. Numerous female figurines were found, very similar if not exactly equal to those found in many Palaeolithic European sites, as well as large menhirs over a metre tall which are believed to have come from the collapse of other structures of the pyramid. In addition, there are large numbers of burials arranged radially around the pyramid.(7) The site of Cuicuilco is covered by  dense volcanic lava field known as the Pedegral de San Angel.

Although the pyramid was discovered in 1920 by archaeologist Manuel Gamio, the first investigations at Cuicuilco were carried out by Byron Cumming, between 1923 and 1924, which led to the discovery of the civic core of the site and the main pyramid.
By 200 BC, Cuicuilco was one of the most important and larger centres in Central Mexico, and it has been estimated that its area covered approximately 400 ha, with a population of 20,000 people.
The test for the base of the sediments gave an age of 2,200 years B.P. Radiocarbon dates from below the lava flow date the original construction of the building between 800 and 600 BC.(2)Discovery of a campfire at the base of the building has placed the earliest occupation of the area at 2,000 BC(7) The Cuicuilco pyramid was one of the first true urban centres in the Basin of Mexico.
The new dates, obtained from material which clearly is contemporaneous with the volcanic activity, suggest that the eruption took place around 1670 years BP, some 300 years later than previously thought.(3) ""He with the navel"" (Xitli), according to the scribe Alva Ixtlilxochitl, ""opened the earth and swept everything in its path, on the day Ahui-Quiahuitl, in the year 8-Tecpatl,"" this translates into April 24 of 76 A.D."" (1)  Archaeology has concluded that Cuicuilco was a prominent community prior to the emergence of Teotihuacan as an urban centre, noting the six small communities which eventually combined to become Teotihuacan were founded and showing evidence of modest growth during the time Cuicuilco was building pyramids and public monuments.
The city seems to have been abandoned at around the same time that Teotihuacan entered its main growth phase, following the eruption of the Xitle volcano.The site of Cuicuilco is covered by  dense volcanic lava field known as the Pedegral de San Angel.
In addition, there are large numbers of burials arranged radially around the pyramid.(7) The site of Cuicuilco is covered by  dense volcanic lava field known as the Pedegral de San Angel.
The site is also inside a modern urban area, and is partially covered by buildings associated with the National University of Mexico.

Consequently the true size and complexity of the original site may now be impossible to ascertain.(5) A stela discovered near the pyramid of Cuicuilco is suggested as proof an ancient connection between the Cuicuilco culture and that of the contemporary Olmecs, considered until recently the mother culture of Mesoamerica.(6) Of great surprise to archaeologists was the fact that the entire structure of the pyramid was found to have been covered with a laayer of yellow earth just over 1metre thick, suggesting that the settlers had known in advance of the eruption and had attempted to preserve the building.

"Cuzco, Peru",Inca Capital,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/perucuzco.htm,"Cuzco, Peru","Cuzco is the centre of a network of   spirit-paths (cerques), that radiate across the landscape. The son of the   ninth king, Inca Pachacuti (1438-1471 AD), initiated a road construction   program that ultimately developed over 6,000 miles of road, including one   road 3,000 miles long from Quito in Ecuador to Talca in Chile.(2). Description- Cuzco means 'Navel' in Quechua, and was the 'earth navel' of the Incas nations. Cuzco was occupied by the Inca from around 1,200-1,500 AD, although it was occupied before this time by theKillkeculture from 900 - 1,200 AD. The city is overlooked from the north by the famous walled fortressSacsayhuaman. Although there are still some remains and foundations of Inca buildings, most were lost following the sacking by Pizarro in 1535. today there are only a few structures left to see such as the palace of the Incas, the Temple of the Sun (Coricancha) and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun. The excellent stonework, of perfectly carved Andesite blocks, along with other construction features, is  noticeably reminiscent of Egyptian architecture. The granite Inca walls have survived several earthquakes while other newer structures have fallen, The Coricancha  was   originally covered with plates of   gold, and its interior contained a series of temples dedicated to the sun,   moon, rainbow, stars, and thunder and lightning. Golden, bejewelled   objects were found throughout, and the Temple of the Moon was covered in   sheets of silver. The courtyard, or ""golden garden"" contained life-size   gold replicas of the animals and plants of the kingdom. 'The Coricancha was the   sighting centre for a remarkable system of radial organisation. Radiating   out from the  Coricancha, 41 sight lines stretched to the horizon and   beyond. Along these lines or adjacent  to them were built  328 'huacas'   or survey points, suggested by some as representing the number of    days in 12 sidereal lunar months. One third of these ceque points   comprised the major springs and water sources of the region'.(4)  The principle myth describes the founders of Cuzco as two 'children of the Sun'.Manco CapacandMama Occlo Huaco, who were both brother and sister and husband and wife.   Sent by the Sun, the couple advanced from lake Titicaca with a golden   wedge, which was destined to sink into the earth without any effort at   their final place of residence, which was Cuzco.(2).

"Delos, Greece",Oracle centre,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/greecedelos.htm,"Delos, Greece","One of the most important mythological, historical and archaeological sites in Greece. Indeed, its location at the centre of the Cyclades gives rise to the theory that the name of the Cyclades group of islands in the Aegean sea comes from the word, circle or 'kyklos' that form around the island of Delos. As well as being an important archaeological site, Delos is connected geometrically with other important Greek sites and is a part of the 'oracle  octave' as proposed by Livvio Stecchini. Delos, along with many of the Greek islandswas first occupied sometime during the 3rd millennium BCE (5). The importance of the island is made clear in Greek mythology, where it is said to be the birthplace of Apollo, although it functioned as a religious location and sanctuary long before the Greeks decreed it the birthplace of two of their most important gods.A number of ""purifications"" were executed by the city-state of Athens in an attempt to render the island fit for the proper worship of the Gods. The first took place in the 6th century BC, and was directed by Pisistratus, who ordered that all graves within sight of the temple be dug up and the bodies moved to another nearby island. Such was the importance of the island that    In the 5th century, during the 6th year of the Peloponnesian war and under instruction from the Delphic Oracle, the entire island was purged of all dead bodies and it was decreed Evidence of the first inhabitants of the island is thought to have occurred around 2,800-2,500 B.C. Excavations have discovered the ruins of this pre-historic settlement on the top of the low hill of Mount Kynthos. The island reached its climax in the archaic (7th-8th century B.C.) and classical (5th -4th centuries B.C.) period after Hellenes from all over the ancient Greek world gathered there to worship the twin god and goddess Apollo and Artemis, completing the prophesy by Leto. For much of its history, the island was a thriving commercial port with population estimates onward to a staggering 30,000 people. Under the Romans in the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. as many as 10,000 slaves were said to be sold there on some days. The prosperity of Delos reached an end, following the attack by Mithridates of Pontus, a monarch from Asia Minor, who went to war with Rome and conquered the island in 88 B.C., slaughtered its 20,000 inhabitants, and sailed away with ships loaded with the treasures of the island.(3) According to mythology, Leto, pursued by the incensed and jealous goddess Hera, wandered from place to place seeking some corner of the earth in which to give birth to her children, the fruit of her union with Zeus, father of the Gods. But all the Islands and cities refused to receive her, afraid of the vengeance of Zeus' deceived consort, whom only a bare rock in the middle of the tempestuous sea dared to defy. Prior to this event, the island had floated aimlessly in the Aegean, but became anchored in its position by Poseidon who made four granite columns rise out of the sea to anchor it firmly in its present place for the divine birth. This is why the island came to be called Delos, which means 'visible', before which it was a floating, nomadic rock called Ortygia or Adelos (the invisible). It is said that it was on Delos that Leto finally bore the twins, Apollo and Artemis under a palm.In return for the sanctuary of the island, she promised that the god she was about to give birth to would turn this dry and barren island into a place of great pilgrimage and bring prosperity to its land. It is interesting that Herodoyus made mention of a 'floating island' named Khemmis, at Buto in Egypt (2.156) where Isis is said to have given birth to Horus. On this island there is a Temple of Leto (Wadjet), and also a temple to Apollo, but Herodotus dismissed the claim that it floated as merely the legend of Delos brought to Egypt from Greek tradition. The Romans called Leto ""Latona"". Note too that theOsireionat Abydoss, contained an artificial floating 'island', associated with Isis through Osiris. As well as the thriving slave market and busy harbour port, the island supported a large residential quarters and extensive temples, shrines and centres of purification. In addition, the island's profile was maintained through the Delian Festivals and Games which were held there every 4 years (with a 6,000 - seat amphitheatre still present). It is indeed remarkable thatthe island was capable of sustaining such prosperity in light of the fact that it has never had any productive capacity for food, timber, and limited natural water sources. What water was naturally available, such as rain water was exploited with an fantastic extensive cistern and aqueduct system, wells, and sanitary drains. (water tanks are still present with capacities of 27,000 litres) The oracle of Apollo on Delos was only consulted when Apollo made Delos his 'summer residence', for his winter abode was said to be at Patara, a city of Lycia. The temple of Apollo, was, according to Strabo, (lib. x.) begun by Erysiapthus, the son of Cecrops, who is said to have possessed this island 1558 years B. C.; but it was afterwards much enlarged and embellished at the general charge of all the Grecian states. But Plutarch says, that is was one of the most stately buildings in the universe, and describes its altar, as deserving a place among the seven wonders of the world. The inscription in this temple, as Aristotle informs us, (Ethic. I. i. c. 9.) was as follows: ""Of all things the most beautiful is justice; the most useful is health; and the most agreeable is the possession of the beloved object."" Travelling to Delphi in the late 1950s, Jean Richer, professor of literature with a special interest in symbolism, wondered about the connection between Delphi, site of Apollo's main sanctuary and oracle, and Delos, the god's traditional birthplace, as well as Delphi's relationship with Athena, so prominently represented at the sanctuary. While in Athens, insight came in a dream: a figure of Apollo, facing directly away from him, turned slowly through 180 degrees to face him. Awaking, he found a map and drew a straight line joining Delphi, Athens, and Delos, revealing a spatial relationship among these sacred sites. Over several years Richer continued finding alignments by drawing lines on the map which formed geometric figures, many of which obviously represented projections or correspondences on earth of celestial objects and directions. In fact, ""it quickly became clear that the Greeks, like the ancient Mesopotamians and the Egyptians, had wanted to make their country a living image of the heavens."" He soon became convinced that Greece had been divided into twelve sectors corresponding to the twelve signs of the zodiac, with Delphi as the centre oromphalos, the ""navel"" of the Greek mainland. Examining art and artefacts from cities and temples in the pie-shaped sectors, Richer found that, far from containing arbitrary decorations, the images predominantly related to the seasons, solstices, cardinal points, and zodiacal signs corresponding to their particular sector of the Delphic ""zodiac."" Further investigation revealed a second zodiacal wheel centred on Delos, which furnished the Aegean islands with sacred celestial directions and correspondences; and a third, older wheel also centred on Sardis, capital of Lydia (in present-day Turkey), a city on the same latitude as Delphi. Finally, he found a still more ancient system centred on Ammoneion in the Libyan desert, home of the oracle of Ammon. It shared the north-south axis or 'meridian' with Delos and included such objects as the Sphinx at Giza in its sectors.

"Delphi, Greece",Oracle Centre,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/greecedelphi.htm,"Delphi, Greece","The foundation of the oracle at Delphi extends back into prehistory. While it was known as the greatest oracle in the world during the Classic Greek  period, it has a provenance that can be traced back to a site of worship of the mother goddess Gaia. The site of the   Delphine Oracle, arguably the most important oracle in the classic   world and sacred since prehistoric times(1),   originally being a shrine to Gaia, a fact to which various authorities   testify (i.e.AeschylusandEuripides). Delphi is also   associated with the worship of Apollo (the sun god), who is said to   have killed the serpentPythonat Delphi, essentially   supplanting one form of worship with another. The sites status as an   Earth Navel was recognised by Herodotus, who connected the oracle   centre at Delphi with the one at Karnak in Egypt, both sites at which Omphalos stones have been found. 'Geological studies showed that Apollo's temple was built possibly upon two crossed seismogenous and hydrophilous faults. Geochemical studies illustrate the existence of vapours such as methane, ethane, ethylene and carbon dioxide eminating from the faults   The foundation of the oracle of Delphi is described by three early writers: The author of theHomeric Hymn to Apollo, Aeschylus in the prologue to theEumenides, and Euripides in a chorus in theIphigeneia in Tauris. All three versions disagree with each other basically, but have been superficially combined in the conventional version of late classical times."" The Euripides version reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of    Earth. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in theHomeric Hymn, a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. TheHomeric Hymn, as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of Dodona: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats."" ... ""Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or centre of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by Zeus who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place... So although Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or    Gaia, It is sufficient interpret him as theHomeric Hymnrepresents him -- as a northern intruder -- and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times.

The Geodetic nature of Delphi- The foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before the times of recorded history. In relation to this, it is interesting to note that the origin of Delphi is associated with the myth of Zeus releasing two doves simultaneously from the eastern and western  'edges' of the earth, reflecting a knowledge of earth's sphericity. Delphi also lies along the same alignment formed by connectingDodonato Behdet in Egypt (which was the geodetic capital of Northern Egypt before 3,000 BC according to Stecchini), and which sits on the same longitude as Thebes and the same Latitude as Alexandria. Herodotus connected Delphi withThebes (Karnak)in his narration. As proof of Delphi's recognition of its coordinating role in the positioning of isolated temples all over Greece we have Plato's and Aristotle's statements which indicate that the 'Delphic priests were responsible for placing temples and shrines in accordance with a Delphi is associated with two points in Asia and Africa. These points form an inverted giant Isosceles triangle. Its corners are composed from Navels.

The   cities at Derinkuyu and Kaymaklı are two of the best examples of underground dwellings.(2) The largest of the Cappadocia underground complexes  Derinkuyu underground settlement was opened to visitors in 1965, but so far only 10% can be visited. Entry is through tunnels that force one to almost crawl on occasion in order to force invaders into single file... One tunnel on the third level of Derinkuyu is said to connect to the nearby underground city of Kaymakli (5km distant).(3) The massive circular doors -These circular doors are visible at all the local underground sites. They were rolled across the passages and sealed the citadels from the inside. At Derinkuyu Each level could also be sealed individually.  When were they constructed? Wikipedia says of it:'First built by the Phrygians in the 8th-7th centuries B.C according to the Turkish Department of Culture, the underground city at Derinkuyu was enlarged in the Byzantine era.The oldest written source about underground cities is the writings of Xenophon (ca. 431 ï¿½ 355 BC). In his Anabasis he writes that the people living in Anatolia had excavated their houses underground, living well in accommodations large enough for the family, domestic animals, and supplies of stored food'.  In origin, the cities are thought to date back to Hittite times at least (1900ï¿½1200 BC). Hittite-style seals have been found during excavations and other Hittite remains, such as a lion statue, have turned up in the area. It is possible that the underground rooms were used as shelters during the attacks of 1,200 BC, when the Hittite Empire was destroyed by invaders from Thrace. Later the complexes were enlarged by other civilizations, and the presence of missionary schools, churches and wine cellars would seem to indicate that they were used by Christian communities. Kaymakli (Ozluce)Roughly10 kilometres to the north of Derinkuyu, is smaller and less excavated but 5 levels are accessible. Ozluce Underground settlement is different from the others in terms of its geological formation and architectural features. The underground settlement hastufaof different colours. There is only one floor in this underground settlement which has not been completely opened; however, it covers a very large area. At the entrance is a place with two intertwining arches made of basalt. Access to the maintufastone can be gained through a 15 m long passage, made of rubble stone. The stone places, which lead to the underground settlement, are more recent than the rock hollowed places that form the underground settlement. At the end of this passage there is a millstone door which is made of hard granite and is 1.75 m in diameter. Being the largest area in the underground settlement, the main space at the entrance consists of two parts. To the right of the main space are storage rooms, and to the left are living areas. On the sides of the long corridors are cell-like rooms and on the floor are traps.(1) Tatlarin (The Castle).-Christianised underground settlement. The village of Tatlarin, located 10 km north of the town of Acigol, is one of the interesting places in Cappadocia because of both its underground settlement and churches and the architecture of its houses. Its underground settlement, located on the hill called ï¿½the castleï¿½ by the locals of the village, was first discovered in 1975 and opened to the public in 1991. The size of the chambers in the underground settlement, only two floors of which can be visited; the presence of the toilets, which also can only be found at the Guzelyurt Underground Settlement; the abundance of the depots for food and of the churches make one think that this place was either a garrison or a monastic complex rather than an underground settlement.(1)    ï¿½zkonak(Avanos). Built on the northern slopes of Mt. Idis about 14 km northeast of Avanos in Turkeyhas many strata made up of volcanic granite. The larger areas of the city are connected to each other by tunnels. ï¿½zkonak had a built in communication system of pipes to each of its levels, unlike Kaymakli and Derinkuyu which have no such communication systems. Each carved out room had ventilation provided by holes when the city was closed against enemies. ï¿½zkonak was discovered in 1972 by a local farmer named Latif Acar, who was curious about where his excess crop water was disappearing to. Latif discovered an underground room which, when later excavated, revealed a whole city which could house an incredible 60,000 people for up to three months. Although only four floors are now open, the complex contains a total of ten floors, to a depth of 40m.

"Devil's Arrows, England",Alignment of Standing Stones,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englanddevilsarrows.htm,"The Devil's Arrows, England","These stones form an important part of the prehistoric landscape, forming alignments with other sites including several henges as far away as Thornborough complex (called the 'Stonehenge of the North'), and one of the most important prehistoric sites in Northern England. Description-The Devils Arrows sit next to the A1 at Buroughbridge by the river Ure. Three stones remain, they are 18ft, 22ft and 22ft 6in tall, the last of these being taller than anything at Stonehenge. The smallest of the stones is rectangular ï¿½ about 8ft 6in by 4ft 6in. The 22ft stone is 5ft by 4ft in girth and the third and tallest 4ft 6in by 4ft.(1) Probably originally a five-stone row. The fourth stone was reputedly broken up in 1582 to build the bridge over the River Tutt, and the fifth is lost in history. The stones are of grit-stone, having pointed tops, with a fluted effect also seen inSt Uzec, France, and are buried over 1.5m into the ground.(An excavation of the smallest stone in 1876 revealed a hole 4ft 6in deep and five years later, an excavation of the tallest Arrow showed 6ft of it to be buried in the ground)(1). The stones are composed of   millstone grit and the likely source is Plumpton Rocks two miles south   of Knaresborough where erosion has produced large quantities of   individual slabs. The lightest of the Arrows weighs over 25 tons and   would have had to be pulled over a distance of some nine miles. Recent   experiments (including one televised in 1996 ï¿½Secrets of Lost   Empiresï¿½) have proved the feasibility of moving and erecting such   stones without the benefit of modern equipment and technology. It is   estimated that the arduous pull from Plumpton to Boroughbridge would   have taken six months. 'A report of a visit by John Leland in   the 1530s gives a clear and detailed description of four standing stones.   Thirty years later William Camden wrote of seeing ï¿½foure huge stones, of   pyramidal forme, but very rudely wrought, set as it were in a straight and   direct line... whereof one was lately pulled downe by some that hoped,   though in vaine, to find treasureï¿½.(1) ï¿½Peter Franck, a fisherman who travelled much about the world to enjoy his sport, came to Boroughbridge in 1694 and says he saw seven of these standing stones, Dr Stukeley mentions five, and John Leyland, in his travels, saw ï¿½four great stones wrought by manï¿½s hands,ï¿½ but no inscription upon them. Camden, in 1592, saw four, but one of them at the time was thrown down, ï¿½for,ï¿½ says he, ï¿½the accursed love of gain.ï¿½ Part of this one is still to be seen, built into the Peggy Bridge which crosses the Tut on the entrance to the town, the top portion being preserved in the grounds of Aldborough Manor and this goes far to prove ï¿½ and I have very carefully considered the question and examined the ground ï¿½ that the original number of stones was far greater, and reached from the Yore, in equal distances to the Tudland of Leylandï¿½s time, or the Staveley Beck of today. If this argument is correct, 2000 years ago there would be a line of at least 12 standing monoliths guarding the western approach to Isur Brigantium.ï¿½ Having noted an alignment relating to the three Thornborough Circles, one can see that these three henges also share an offset-alignment, as do the nearby henges on Hutton Moor, and a group of three tumuli there also. This 'elbow' alignment between three monuments is seen at several other circles in England, and is often suggested as being related to Orion's Belt. Astronomy - The story which led to the latter name is thought to date from the end of the 17th century: Old Nick, irritated by some slight from Aldborough, threw the stones at the village from his stance on How Hill (south of Fountains Abbey). His aim, or his strength, being below par the ï¿½arrowsï¿½ fell short by a good mile.  It was also claimed, and perhaps still is, that walking 12 times around the stones anti-clockwise will raise the Devil.(1)   Each of the standing stones has a series of grooves at the top which   are disputably thought to have been carved by man (or the result of weathering). They show no trace of tool working   today ï¿½ and   the same grooves of varying lengths can be observed at Plumpton rocks   where the stones for the Devil's Arrows are suggested to have originated. The first recorded excavation at the foot of the stones was in 1709   when a 9ft area around the central stone was opened. This revealed   that, just below the topsoil, cobbles, grit and clay had been packed   around the stone to a depth of 5ft. The base of the stone had been   dressed by pointed tools to produce a smooth bottom which sat squarely on the hard packed   clay beneath.

"Dodona, Greece",Oracle Centre,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/greecedodona.htm,"Dodona, Greece","Dodona was the oldest Hellenic oracle centre according to the fifth-century historian Herodotus. Aristotle considered the region to have been the most ancient part of Greece and where the Hellenes originated. Herodotus records two different accounts for the origin of Dodona. He wrote firstly that he was told by priests at Egyptian Thebes (Karnak) that  ""two priestesses had been carried away from Thebes by Phoenicians; one, they said they had heard was taken away and sold in Libya, the other in Hellas; these women, they said, were the first founders of places of divination in the aforesaid countries."" This story suggests that the oracles at the oasis of Siwa in Libya and of Dodona in Epirus were equally old, but similarly transmitted from Egypt by Phonecians, and that the priestesses were women. Herodotus also recorded what he was told by the prophetesses, calledpeleiades(""doves"") at Dodona which wasthat 'two black doves had come flying from Thebes in Egypt, one to Libya and one to Dodona; the latter settled on an oak tree, and there uttered human speech, declaring that a place of divination from Zeus must be made there; the people of Dodona understood that the message was divine, and therefore established the oracular shrine. The dove which came to Libya told the Libyans (they say) to make an oracle of Ammon; this also is sacred to Zeus. Such was the story told by the Dodonaean priestesses, the eldest of whom was Promeneia and the next Timarete and the youngest Nicandra; and the rest of the servants of the temple at Dodona similarly held it true'. Having mentioned that Herodotus associated the origin of Dodona with Thebes in Egypt (above), it is of interest that both sites have been proposed to have been located according to an apparentlydeliberate geodetic placementof sacred temples and shrines. Dodona is the Mythological landing place for Deucalion after the flood, while Ararat is known in Hebraic as the landing place of the Ark for Noah. Apart from this early mythological connection between sites, there is a geographical similarity in that both have ancient oracle centres to the earth-mother placed next to dominant mountains and the distance between them is the same as the distance between Dodona and Thebes, so that the three sites form an almost exact equilateral triangle . In the Case of Dodona which lies at 'Stecchini maintains   that the iconographically consistent presence of pairs of   pigeons, perched on, or on either side of, theomphaloi, or ""navels,"" of the ancient world, are an indication of   their function as the measurers of the geodetic absolute   center.He adds, that, ""from prehistoric times""...""carrier pigeons [were] used for establishing geographic   distances. According to Greek legends, a central geodetic point was obtained by loosing two birds of equal strength and using the mean of the time employed in flight. This would allow for differences in wind current and other variables. By repeated flights even more accurate measurements could be obtained.In ancient literature and iconography the flight of two doves is the standard symbol for the stretching of meridians and parallels. With Stecchini's   information in hand, it becomes possible to see that the   dove-stories originating out of Egypt are a direct reference   to the mathematical calculations used by the Egyptian priests   to establish that their place in the world was at the absolute   center'.

"Dolni Vestonice, Czech,","Upper Palaeolithic, Art",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/czechdolnivestonice.htm,Dolni Vestonice,"The site is unique in that it has been a particularly abundant source of prehistoric artefacts (especially art) dating from roughly 28,000 to 24,000 B.C(4). In addition to functional tools, the artefacts found at Dolni Věstonice include carved representations of animals, men, women, personal ornaments, enigmatic engravings. The remains of two dwellings were unearthed: an oval one (15 x 9m), with five hearths, and a round one (6m in diameter) with one hearth in the centre in which clay figurines were fired. The remains of two kilns have been uncovered and more than 700 figurines-nearly all depicting Ice Age animals(1)such as lions, rhinos, and mammoths-were fired in the oval earthen kilns of Dolni Vestonice. At nearby sites of similar age, thousands more terracotta figurines and clay pellets have been excavated. Almost all the Vestonice figurines exhibit breaks and cracks-the shattering shock of the flames that baked them.  One hypothesis is that these figurines had magical significance, and were intentionally fashioned from wet clay so that they would explode when fired. The clay would have been mixed either with ash from certain plants or a different equivalent The ceramic figurines and fragments recovered from Dolni Vestonice have been identified as representing the earliest known ceramic technology (Vandiver et al., 1989).  The Moravian site ï¿½clusterï¿½ has yielded more than 10,000 ceramic fragments.  The figurines recovered from Dolni Vestonice have been dated to 26,000 BP, while the worldï¿½s earliest known pottery vessels until this time appear 14,000 years later.(3) The early origin of ceramic technology at Dolni Vestonice suggests that the local population were familiar with their surroundings and have demonstrated an ability to manipulate and control their environment.  If the ceramics were being produced simply to be shattered via thermal shock, it can be concluded that the process of making the objects was more important than the final product(4). . The Venus of Dolnï¿½ Věstonice is one of the earliest examples of fired clay sculptures in the world (c. 28,000ï¿½24,000BC(4)).  It has four holes in the head, the function of which is unknown. A Tomograph scan in 2004 found a fingerprint of a child estimated at between 7 and 15 years of age(1) One of the burials revealed a human female skeleton, ritualistically placed beneath a pair of mammoth scapulae, one leaning against the other. The bones and the earth surrounding it contained traces of redochre, aflint spearhead had been placed near the skull and one hand held the body of afox. This evidence has led to suggestions that this was the burial site of ashaman. This is the oldest site not only of ceramic figurines and artistic portraiture, but also of evidence offemale shaman. The following extract is J. Shreeve's book 'The Neandertal Enigma: solving the mystery of modern human origins': In the spring of 1986, near a village called Dolni Vestonice in the Czech province of Moravia, the bodies of three teenagers were discovered in a common grave. A specialist was immediately summoned from Brno, some twenty-five miles to the north, and under his care the remains were exhumed and faint remnants of the youths' identities revealed. Two of the skeletons were heavily built males. By its slender proportions, the third was judged to be female, aged seventeen to twenty. A marked left curvature of the spine, along with several other skeletal abnormalities, suggested that she had been painfully crippled. The two males had died healthy, in the prime of their lives. The remains of a thick wooden pole thrust through the hip of one of them hinted that his death might not have been entirely natural.The bodies had been buried with curious attention. According to the expert Bohuslav Klima, of the Czech Institute of Archaeology in Brno both young men had been laid to rest with their heads encircled with necklaces of pierced canine teeth and ivory; the one with the pole thrust up to his coccyx may also have been wearing some kind of painted mask. All three skulls were covered in red ochre. The most peculiar feature of the grave, however, was the arrangement of the deceased. Whoever committed the bodies to the ground extended them side by side, the woman between her two companions. The man on her left lay on his stomach, facing away from her but with his left arm linked with hers. The other male lay on his back, his head turned toward her. Both of his arms were reaching out, so that his hands rested on her pubis. The ground surrounding this intimate connection was splashed with red ochre.(2) American Journal of Physical Anthropology. 2001 Aug;115(4):372-9.(Quick-link)The Upper Palaeolithic triple burial of Dolni Vestonice: Pathology and funerary behaviour.Formicola V, Pontrandolfi A, Svoboda J.Department of Ethology, Ecology, and Evolution, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.This work focuses on palaeopathological analysis of one of the skeletons from the Gravettian triple burial of Dolni Vestonice (Moravia) and addresses issues of Upper Paleolithic funerary behavior. The burial includes the well-preserved skeletons of three young individuals.The skeleton in the middle (DV 15) is pathological and very problematic to sex;the other two (DV 13 and DV 14) are males and lie in an unusual position. The young age, the possibility of a simultaneous interment, and the position of the three specimens have given rise to speculations about the symbolic significance of this spectacular and intriguing funerary pattern. The pathological condition of the skeleton in the middle further emphasizes its peculiarity. Main pathological changes of the DV 15 skeleton include: asymmetric shortening of the right femur and of left forearm bones, bowing of the right femur, right humerus, and left radius, elongation of fibulae, dysplasias of the vertebral column, and very marked enamel hypoplasias. Scrutiny of the medical literature suggests that the most likely etiology is chondrodysplasia calcificans punctata (CCP) complicated by trauma and early fractures of the upper limbs. CCP is a rare inherited disorder characterized by stippled ossification of the epiphyses. The cartilaginous stippling is a transient phenomenon that disappears during infancy, leaving permanent deformities on affected bones. Among the different forms of CCP, the X-linked dominant form is that resulting in asymmetric shortening and is lethal during early infancy in males.Thus, survival of DV 15 until young adult age would require the specimen to be a female.Clinical findings often associated with the disease (erythemas, ichthyosis, alopecia, cataracts, and joint contractures, among others) would emphasize the singular aspect of this individual, pointing to a condition that should be carefully taken into account when speculating on the significance of that peculiar burial. The surprising discovery of textile imprints at Pavlov I and Dolnï¿½ Věstonice I, II attracted attention and opened discussions. As was the case with ceramics, the textile technologies were also tested experimentally bySoffer et al. (2000)who noted the following: The weavers of Upper Palaeolithic Moravia were not only manufacturing a variety of cordage types but, more important, also producing plaited basketry and twined and plain woven cloth which approach levels of technical sophistication heretofore associated exclusively with the Neolithic and later time periods.Unfortunately, much of this technology is evident only to those who have considerable experience with perishable material culture and have examined the original evidence first-hand. Article: BBC NewsOnline: (June, 2000).Woven cloth dates back 27,000 years. Woven clothing was being produced on looms 27,000 years ago, far earlier than had been thought, scientists say... ...The evidence was obtained from a number of sites in the Czech Republic... ...Some of the fibre impressions may have been made accidentally, such as by sitting on a fresh clay floor or when wet clay was carried in woven bags. ""Other impressions may have been caused by deliberate action, such as lining a basket with clay to make it watertight,"" said Professor Soffer. A detailed examination of the impressions reveals a large variety of weaving techniques. There are open and closed twines, plain weave and nets. Professor Soffer told BBC News Online that twining can be done by hand but plain weave needed a loom. It may be that many stone artefacts found in settlements may not be objects of art as had been supposed but parts of an ancient loom, which should now be considered as the first machine to be made after the wheel... ...Further revelations are to be expected in this area of research. There are recent reports that fragments of burnt textiles have been found adhering to pieces of flint.

The burial includes the well-preserved skeletons of three young individuals.The skeleton in the middle (DV 15) is pathological and very problematic to sex;the other two (DV 13 and DV 14) are males and lie in an unusual position.
The pathological condition of the skeleton in the middle further emphasizes its peculiarity.
Among the different forms of CCP, the X-linked dominant form is that resulting in asymmetric shortening and is lethal during early infancy in males.Thus, survival of DV 15 until young adult age would require the specimen to be a female.Clinical findings often associated with the disease (erythemas, ichthyosis, alopecia, cataracts, and joint contractures, among others) would emphasize the singular aspect of this individual, pointing to a condition that should be carefully taken into account when speculating on the significance of that peculiar burial.

"Dorchester Big-rings, England",Henge and Cursus,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englanddorchesterhenge.htm,Dorchester Henge and Cursus,"The Henge monument to the north of Dorchester, known locally as the ""big rings"", was sadly lost to aggregate extraction in the 1970s. (Not too dissimilar to what is happening atThornboroughtoday). Sadly, all that remains today is a crop-mark. The Henge and associated monuments were built over an existing Cursus monument, something found at other sites such as Thornborough and Stonehenge (which has the same circumference). The 'Big rings Henge monument at Dorchester on Thames, was part of a complex of Neolithic and later monuments clustered around the Cursus (SU 59 NE 5), and designated as site XIII within the complex. First recognised as a crop-mark in 1927, some trenching was undertaken in 1951-2 (including complete excavation of sites XII and XIV). The excavations focused on the northern part of the site, but included examination of the southern entrance. The site comprises two concentric ditch circuits, with roughly opposed entrances to the north-northwest and south-southeast. The outer ditch has a maximum diameter of 193 metres, the inner of 125 metres. Few finds came from the outer ditch - some flints, plus a few Iron Age sherds. The inner ditch was a little more productive. Finds from primary contexts included Beaker sherds, struck flints and animal bones. Possible Peterborough Ware and Collared Urn sherds were also present in the ditch fill. A pit beside the north entrance dug into the inner ditch contained Beaker and Iron Age sherds. The ditch fills suggest the former presence of a bank between the ditches, and traces were found during excavations in this area. A pit beneath the bank material appears to have held a post. Features in the entrance areas may be related to restricting access or blocking but are of uncertain date. Very little was found in the interior area excavated. Site XIV was located between the inner and outer ditch circuits near the south entrance, while Site XII was located just outside the north entrance. Much of the area has since been destroyed by gravel extraction.(1) A Neolithic Cursus at Dorchester on Thames, largely known as crop-marks and partly excavated in 1947-52 and 1981. Much of its course has been destroyed by gravel quarrying and the construction of the Dorchester bypass. It comprised two broadly parallel ditches circa 60 metres apart, running for at least 1600 metres in a more-or-less northwest-southeast direction. The Cursus and its associated complex of monuments (see associated records) run across the neck of a strip of land defined by a bend in the River Thames and a tributary, the Thame. No northwest terminal has been identified, while at the southeast end, there appears to have been no formal terminal. Instead, the Cursus incorporated an earlier D-Shaped enclosure (""Site 1"" - SU 59 SE 163). Several interruptions of varying lengths are visible along both ditches of the Cursus. The cursus also changes direction slightly along its course. The north ditch changes alignment once and the south ditch twice, although these changes in direction do not coincide. In addition to Site 1, the cursus is also pre-dated by the long enclosure known as SIte VIII (SU 59 NE 4). The southern Cursus actually cuts across this enclosure, the Cursus ditch passing through the enclosure's southeast entrance causeway (at which point the Cursus ditch is also interrupted by a causeway). The best dating evidence for the Cursus comes from this area. A polished flint axe came from the primary fill, a lozenge shaped flint arrowhead came from the bottom of the secondary silting, and sherds of both Ebbsfleet Ware and Beaker were reported from the upper fills. An antler from the primary fill has been dated to 3380-2920 BC (calibrated), though whether this genuinely dates the Cursus construction is open to debate. However, dating evidence recovered from earlier and later monuments in the complex supports a broad 2nd half of the 4th millennium BC date, in line with Cursus monuments generally.(2)  Christopher Knight and Alan Butler have suggested that there may also be evidence of use of a 366ï¿½division of the globe in prehistoric times.(4)Their evidence shows that both Thornborough and Stonehenge share similar dimensions which appear to be based on circumferences of units of exactly 366ï¿½megalithic yards. The now completely destroyed Dorchester-on-Thames Henge once shared the exact same circumference of 366 MY with the original 'Henge' at Stonehenge = 1 MY per Meg degree of horizon. Professor Roger Mercer from Edinburgh University, an expert on the Neolithic and Bronze Age described our stretch of the River Thames as""an area of quite extraordinary richness in terms of prehistoric activity not only in its British context but when compared with an equivalent area in North-West Europe."" Professor Alasdair Whittle, from Cardiff University, also an expert of the Neolithic, described the area under threat as""a complex prehistoric landscape, with a startling concentration of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments, among other features, which collectively constitute an archaeological resource of national significance, comparable in importance for example to those around Avebury and Stonehenge."" Humphrey Case, former Keeper of Antiquities at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, and an expert both on the Neolithic and the archaeology of the area, has pointed to the importance of the monuments in the PAGE region:  ""This is one of the few remaining crop-mark complexes un-destroyed by gravel quarrying in the Upper Thames region, and every effort should be made to preserve it.""

"Dorset Cursus, England",10kn long Cursus,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englanddorsetcursus.htm,"Dorset Cursus, England","Today, much of this great earthwork is flattened and can only be see through crop-markings or soil markings  which in the right conditions, allow one to see the outline of the cursus stretching across the Dorset landscape. As with several other cursus, Dorset cursus appears to have a complimentary henge nearby, in the shape ofKnowlton Henge, which is only a short distance to the east. With an estimated half million man hours in construction, this earth-work counts as one of Britain's largest megalithic constructions. Unfortunately today, there is left to see to the untrained eye.The Dorset cursus once consisted of a pair of parallel banks (1.5 m tall) running about 82 m apart, with external ditches 1.5 m deep and 2 m wide. One bank is regular, whilst the other meanders, a feature found at several other cursus in Britain. Believed to have been constructed in two different phases at around 3,300 BC, this cursus must have been of great importance to the Neolithic community that gave birth to it. What is surprising about the Dorset Cursus is that its overall design makes little sense except to someone inside it. From a distance, despite its great length, it would not have been very visible - indeed, some sections may have been dug through wooded areas. The same is true of the curses atStonehengeandRudston. The concept of a cursus seems to exclude outsiders. This is also indicated by the lack of recognisable entrances through the ditches and banks. However, to those who did stand within it, the Dorset Cursus makes its most impressive visual impact between the Bottlebush terminal and the long barrow on Gussage Cow Down, if only because this includes the longest stretch which can be seen from one vantage point. And this alignment is the midwinter sunset sight line. In fact, there seem to be five astronomical sight lines between the cursus and particular mounds, or between mounds. Again, other cursus seem to have been built in similar ways. The Dorchester on Thames cursus aligns on the midsummer sunset, while Aubrey Burl has suggested that the Stonehenge cursus could have marked the equinoctal sunrises. Cursusoften run across valleys, and their setting and scale can only be fully appreciated by standing at the terminals which are usually intervisible. It has frequently been pointed out that many cursus have their terminals close to water courses or run across an interfluve between two rivers. This is especially true of many valley-situated cursus, and it may also be noted that because of their proximity to rivers some cursus are wholly or partly covered by alluvium. The Dorset cursus is no exception to this, crossing a river and three valleys. The Cursus' only significant astronomical alignment is related to its south-westerly orientation: an observer at the Gussage Cursus terminal on Bottlebush Down would see the midwinter sun set behind the long barrow lying across the Cursus on the ridge of Gussage Down. Bradley (in Barrett et al. 1991) emphasise the way in which this phenomena could only have been witnessed from within the cursus itself. The long-barrow itself has been suggested to have been built before the cursus. A connection between the cursus and long-barrows (other cursus). There are sever other long-barrows on Cranborne Chase, and many of these are still found along the route of the Cursus. This association between the Cursus and the alignment of these barrows suggests a common significance. The cursus incorporates at least two long barrows. On Gussage Hill, ST 91 SE 9 lies across the interior of the cursus, while the Pentridge Cursus has SU 01 NW 47 actually incorporated into the bank of the northwestern side, although the barrow's alignment differs slightly.  'The line of the Cursus may either have been established between a series of existing long barrows, or some of the barrows themselves may have been aligned on prominent features of the Cursus. Where both earthworks share the same axis no sequence can be established, but where one appears to be aligned directly on the other, either the relationship is fortuitous or an obvious sequence is involved. The Cursus appears to have been aligned on three earlier barrows, although a number of barrows appear to have been created after the Cursus and share its alignment. Indeed, no less than half the long barrows within a kilometre of the Cursus closely imitate features of the Cursus.'

Easter Island,Earth Navel,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/easterisland.htm,Easter island,"Easter Island is situated in the middle of the Pacific   Ocean, and was one of the primary islands of the Polynesian Island group.   Hundreds of stone statues or 'Maoi' lie scattered around the island, and   encircle it on long raised platforms. The island poses several questions   in regards pre-Columbian contact with the Americas. The small, isolated nature of the island led many to   suggest that this may have led to the eventual implosion of tribal   activity on the island, which culminated only shortly before its discovery   by the Dutch in 1772. Recent studies however suggest that the islanders were masters of their environment and the collapse actually occurred 'following' European contact. A Brief History.The reigning consensus is that Easter Island was colonized around 300-400 AD as part of an eastward migratory trend that originated in Southeast Asia around 2000 BC. The settlers are thought to have been Polynesians from the Marquesas Islands, 3600 km northwest, or the Mangareva (Gambier) Islands, 2500 km west. In 1770 a Spanish party from Peru claimed the island for Spain. A conflict seems to have raged on the island before the arrival of the British navigator Captain James Cook four years later. He found a decimated, poverty-stricken population, and observed that the statue cult seemed to have ended, as most of the statues had been pulled down. Itï¿½s possible that some of the statues were toppled even before the Dutch and Spanish visits but that those sailors did not visit the same sites as Cook. The Frenchman La Pï¿½rouse visited Easter Island in 1786 and found the population calm and prosperous, suggesting a quick recovery from any catastrophe. In 1804 a Russian visitor reported that at least 20 statues were still standing. Accounts from subsequent years suggest another period of destruction so that perhaps only a handful of statues were still standing a decade later. Some of the statues still upright at the beginning of the 19th century were knocked down by western expeditions. 1862- Peruvian slavers took 1,000 men (Most of the male population), to work the Guano Islands of Lima. 100 survivors were later returned, of which 15 reached their homes (carrying smallpox), which almost finished the population of the island.(1) South Americans helped colonise Easter Island centuries before Europeans reached it. Clear genetic evidence has, for the first time, given support to elements of this controversial theory showing that while the remote island was mostly colonised from the west, there was also some influx of people from the Americas. Easter Island is the easternmost island of Polynesia, the scattering of islands that stretches across the Pacific. It is also one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world. So how did it come to be inhabited in the first place? Genetics, archaeology and linguistics all show that as a whole, Polynesia was colonised from Asia, probably from around Taiwan. The various lines of evidence suggest people began migrating east around 5500 years ago, reached Polynesia 2500 years later, before finally gaining Easter Island after another 1500 years. But the Norwegian adventurer Thor Heyerdahl thought otherwise. In the mid-20th century, he claimed that the famous Easter Island statues were similar to those at Tiahuanaco at Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, so people from South America must have travelled west across the Pacific to Polynesia. His famous Kon-Tiki expedition, in which he sailed a balsa wood raft from Peru to the Tuamotu islands of French Polynesia, showed that the trip could have been made. But if it was made, no trace remained. Now Erik Thorsby of the University of Oslo in Norway has found clear evidence to support elements of Heyerdahlï¿½s hypothesis. In 1971 and 2008 he collected blood samples from Easter Islanders whose ancestors had not interbred with Europeans and other visitors to the island. Thorsby looked at the HLA genes, which vary greatly from person to person. Most of the islandersï¿½ HLA genes were Polynesian, but a few of them also carried HLA genes only previously found in Native American populations. But the genes may have been around for longer than that. Thorsby found that in some cases the Polynesian and American HLA genes were shuffled together, the result of a process known ï¿½recombinationï¿½. This is rare in HLA genes, meaning the American genes would need to be around for a certain amount of time for it to happen. Thorsby canï¿½t put a precise date on it, but says it is likely that Americans reached Easter Island before it was ï¿½discoveredï¿½ by Europeans in 1722. Thorsby says there may have been a Kon-Tiki-style voyage from South America to Polynesia. Alternatively, Polynesians may have travelled east to South America, and then returned. There is already evidence for that: chicken bones found in Chile turned out to be Polynesian, so we know that the eastward journey did happen at some stage. However, Thorsbyï¿½s findings donï¿½t mean that Heyerdahlï¿½s ideas have been vindicated. The first settlers to Polynesia came from Asia, and they made the biggest contribution to the population. ï¿½Heyerdahl was wrong,ï¿½ Thorsby says, ï¿½but not completely.ï¿½  Easter Island is perhaps best known for its immense stone statues'Moai', of which there are approximately 900 scattered across the island. Some of the Maoi were placed, facing towards the centre of the island, on platforms called 'Ahu', built along the coasts. Captain Cook was told in 1774 that they were monuments to earlier 'ariki's', or royalty.The 'Maoi' are also described in local tradition as having once possessed 'mana' or a beneficial power. All the giant statues on Easter Island have long ears, and some islanders still practised ear elongation at the time the first Europeans arrived. The custom was also practised in the Marquesas Islands in Polynesia, and in Peru; the Incas said they had inherited the custom from their divine ancestors. The oldest known practice of ear extension was among the mariners in the prehistoric Indus Valley harbour-city of Lothal, where large numbers of big earplugs of the type used in ancient Mexico, Peru, and Easter Island have been found. Hindu rulers subsequently adopted the custom, but it was restricted to members of the royal families and images of the Hindu gods. Buddha images with long ears are found all over Asia, and long-eared stone statues have also been dug up in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. The huge heads were discovered to have bodies beneath the ground which are controversially argued to have become naturally buried over time. This argument is contested by the fact that they were made with more pointed bottom parts and were placed upright in groups, all facing away from the volcanic quarry (in contrast to the way they all once faced inwards on theAhuplatforms). There is said to be a distinct difference between the statues at Rano Raraku and those on theAhuwhich is that the statues at the crater have apointed base, destined to be buried in the ground, while those on theahuhave a flat base, so that they can stand on these monuments. This finding is disputed by Heyerdahl(6), who states categorically that following an examination of hundreds of statues, only one has ever been found with a pointed bottom, and that he believes, was because it was faulty. his contention is that they were all destined to eventually encircle the whole island onAhu. The statues at the crater are scattered around in a random manner, whereas the statues at theahu, when they were still standing, were perfectly aligned and in a group. Although the giant statues appear scattered haphazardly, they actually form three major groups on the inner slope of the crater, facing north, such that they all have their backs to the face of the volcanic rock from which they were carved. The following statistics on Easter Island's moai are the results of Van Tilburg's survey in 1989. She reported, ""A total of 887 monolithic statues has been located by the survey to date on Easter Island...397 are still in situ in quarries at the Rano Raraku central production centre.....Fully 288 statues (32% of 887) were successfully transported to a variety of image ahu locations....Another 92 are recorded as ""in transport,"" 47 of these lying in various positions on prepared roads or tracks outside the Rano Raraku zone."" Less than one third of all carved moai actually made it to a final ceremonial ahu site. Was this due to the inherent difficulties in transporting them? Were the ones that remain in the quarry (45%) deemed culturally unworthy of transport? Were they originally intended to remain in place on the quarry slopes? Or had the islanders run out of the resources necessary to complete the Herculean task of carving and moving the moai? There were clearly some very large stones carved on this island, and a When proof was found in 1978 that   some of the Easter Island statues once had inlaid eyes, it came as a   shock to many researchers, who had opposed the idea on the grounds   that this was not a Polynesian custom. Inlaid eyes were a common   feature of many of the oldest images of the Middle East, from Egypt to   the Indus Valley. The seafaring Hittites, for example, adopted the   practice from the Sumerians. Many prehistoric American stone statues   also had inlaid eyes.  The finest platform masonry, such as that found at Ahu Tahiri (one of the two ahu at Vinapu), consists of ï¿½enormous squared and tooled stones, that turn the edge of the toughest modern steelï¿½. The best facade slabs commonly weigh 2 or 3 tons. At Vinapu one of the polished basalt slabs measures 2.5 by 1.7 m (8 by 5.5 ft) and weighs 6 or 7 tons, while one at Ahu Vai Mata is 3 by 2 m (10 by 6 ft), and weighs 9 or 10 tons. The cyclopean masonry of Ahu Vinapu   and certain other platforms is reminiscent of that of ï¿½Incanï¿½ (or   ratherpre-Incan) monuments to be found atCuzco,Sacsayhuaman,Ollantaytambo,Machu Picchu, and Sillustani - All inPeru.   John Macmillan Brown writes: The colossal blocks are tooled and cut so as to fit each other. In the Ahu Vinapu and in the fragment of theahunear Hangaroa beach the stones are as colossal as in the old Temple of the Sun in Cuzco, they are as carefully tooled, and the irregularities of their sides that have to come together are so cut that the two faces exactly fit into each other. These blocks are too huge to have been shifted frequently to let the mason find out whether they fitted or not. They must have been cut and tooled to exact measurement or plan. There is no evidence of chipping after they have been laid. Every angle and projection must have been measured with scientific precision before the stones were nearing their finish.   Around 20 Ahu appear to have been oriented astronomically, so that the moai faced the rising or setting sun at the solstices or equinoxes. The inland ahu with astronomical orientation are generally linked with the solstices, especially the winter solstice, though the moai of Ahu Akivi face the setting sun at the equinoxes. Astronomically oriented ahu along the coast tend to be positioned so that the moai look straight east or west. This is true of Ahu Tahiri (Vinapu 1), whereas Ahu Vinapu 2 marks the summer solstice.(5)   It is an interesting fact that the islanders of Easter Island worship a mysterious site with 5 stone spheres; in the centre of a round stone-enclosure is a bigger stone sphere with 4 smaller stone spheres surrounding it. The site, ""Te pito kura"" must have been a ritual centre for the earliest islanders to pray and divine for something.The stone sphere on Easter Isle is at the northern coastal area of the island, just north of the statue quarry at the volcanic crater of Rano Raraku. The islanders have a legend that the statues were moved to the platforms and raised upright by the use ofmana, or mind power. Either the godMakemake, or priests or chiefs commanded them to walk or to float through the air, and according to one legend, use was made of a finely crafted stone sphere, 75 cm (2.5 ft) in diameter, calledte pito kura(ï¿½the golden navelï¿½ or ï¿½the navel of lightï¿½), to focus themana. The Rapa Nui term ""Te Pito Kura"" translates to ""Golden Navel"", or ""Navel of Light"", while ""Te Pito Te Henua"" translates to ""Navel of the World""; which is what Rapa Nui is often referred to by its residents, referencing its place in Polynesian mythology. This specific site isthe navel of the navel, as it were, located on the island's shore near Anakena, the spot where Rapa Nui's legendary founding figure, Hotu Matura, is said to have landed. Stone barriers surround a worked stone sphere (the ""navel"" itself) measuring some 75 centimetres in diameter, reputedly brought by Hotu Matura from overseas. Geological sourcing, however, indicates the sphere is actually of local origin. The incised written tablets termed 'rongo-rongo' were found suspended from the roof in every hut on the arrival of the first missionary(6). On his order, the majority were burnt, while others were hidden away in secret family caves where they deteriorated and perished. Very few have survived today. It was clearly documented by early missionaries that even the most intelligent and well informed islanders could provide the meaning for any of the signs or provide ideograms for the simplest of words. The following quotes come from Hyerdahl's excellent treaty on 'Early Man and The Ocean'(6): 'They knew each tablet to represent a specific text, but disagreed about which text belonged to which tablet. If one tablet was substituted for another in the middle of their recital, the continued the original text uninterruptedly. The text was recited with singing rather than speaking voice. They piously copied the original old tablets on new boards, and regarded them as magic objects of the greatest value' Although there were several claims that the script had been deciphered, none have proven worthy of scrutiny. Script itself is a non-Polynesian characteristic and the search for its origin was eventually rewarded through one of its paricular characteristics, which is that it is 'arranged in boustrophedon, i.e. in a continuous serpentine band where every second line is turned upside-down. Europeans, Chinese and the Indus Valley people never wrote in 'The Cunas (of the modern Republic of Panama) today generally write on paper. But beside this, written wooden tablets also exist, and the Cuna's say that these were the original writing material. The tablets seen by Nordenskiold were intended to be hung up in the houses during celebrations. The ideograms are painted on with colours...Also the writing is in boustrophedon, and with the succession of lines running upwards from the bottom'(6) The Cuna signs however, although continued in boustrophedon, are not upside-down on each alternate line, and are individually dissimilar to the Easter island signs. The Easter islanders themselves are specific in their tradition of the first immigrant king, Hotu Matua, having brought with him sixty-seven written tablets when he came from his home in the far-east. Heyerdahl mentions that on the arrival of the Europeans, the Indians of Lake Titicaca area still 'continued a primitive form of picture writing'(6). This conforms with the observation by Russian rongo-rongo expert J. V. Knorozov, that the only two places where 'reversed boustrophedon' occur in the world are Easter Island and ancient Peru. Sariemento Gamboa, upon consulting as assembly of forty-two learned Inca historians recorded the following in reference to the ninth Inca 'Patchacuti Inca Yupanqui': '...after he had well ascertained the most notable of their ancient histories he had it all painted after its order on large boards, and he placed them in the house of the sun, where the said boards, which were garnished with gold, would be like our libraries, and he appointed learned men who could understand and explain them...'(6)  The entire social life of the Easter islanders used to revolve around the Bird Cult (manutara: the good-luck bird). Moreover, of all the traditions and customs this cult was the last to disappear. The main ceremony every year was organized with the goal of choosing the chief (the chief warrior, in particular), who was called thetangata manu(literally, Man Bird). The man who becametangata manuwas the first one to find an egg laid by a migrating sea bird with a long beak, the sooty tern or sea swallow.  The islanders had chosen, for this competition and the accompanying ceremony, the southernmost promontory on the island, where the Kau or Kao volcano (Rano Kau) is located. This crater is 1,300 meters high and approximately three-quarters of a mile in diameter,198and there is a small lake, surrounded by grasses and bushes, at the bottom of the crater. On the side of the crater that faces the interior of the island, the slope is quite gentle while, on the other side, the crater forms steep cliffs of more than 400 feet in height199that are battered by ocean waves. It is the most impressive site on the island both because of its beauty and because of the silence that reigns there, broken only by the noise of the crashing waves and the strident cries of the sea birds as they hover near their nests on the cliffs.  The owner of the egg, henceforth protected by the gods, becametangata manuorman-bird210. Unlike the kings, who were not allowed to cut their hair, he had to shave his head and dye his pate red. Then he had to put on a wig-like crown made of human hair, called ahau oho, and paint his face red and black. He had to hang a bird on his back211and, finally, he had to change his name, with his new name designating the year that would follow212. Thus, Mrs. Routledge was able to establish a list of 86 years of different birdmen (and the names of the victorioushopu). Immediately after the transfer of power, via the egg, the news was announced by lighting a fire on the summit of Rano Kau on the east or west side, depending on the region of the island from which the victor had come. It is possible, as suggested by S. Routledge, that the next thing that happened was the carving on one of the rocks at Orongo of an image of the birdman who had just been chosen and that this practice explains the more than 111 representations oftangata manuthat are found there (as well as many that have been erased; see Addendum). The fact that three of these sculptures represent atangata manuholding an egg in his hand seems to support this hypothesis.  On the side of the volcanic crater that faces the sea, there is a little village called Orongo, which consists of about fifty dwellings. These dwellings were located among the rocks, many of which were carved. The carvings most often represented a man with the head of a bird and Mrs. Routledge reported 111 such images. It is interesting that she also noticed that some of the carvings were partly hidden by the walls of houses and she suggested that the carvings had been made before the houses had been built.  The most beautiful and the most venerated idol of the ancient islanders, known asHoa hakanana iaor the ï¿½Breaker of Waves"", was located in one of these houses. This statue is very finely carved and its back is decorated with beautifully carved motifs (Click here for larger image). These motifs were not only carved but were also accented by red paint the statueï¿½s white background. On each side of this statue, at its feet, there was originally a large stone, with a hole similar to those carved in the stones in which house supports were inserted. One of these stones was also decorated with a crude carving. (Extract From Chavin)  Some plants on Easter Island clearly come from South America, such as the islandersï¿½ staple food the sweet potato (which is known by its Quechua namekumara), and also manioc and gourd. Similarly, two species of freshwater plants, found in Easter Islandï¿½s crater lakes but nowhere else in the Pacific, and both useful to man, come from South America. One of them was the totora reed, which dominated the banks of South Americaï¿½s Lake Titicaca and was cultivated in vast irrigated fields in the desert valleys on the coast below; it was used for making mats, houses, and boats. The other was known to the islanders astavari, and was used as a medicinal plant. Like the totora, it grew in Lake Titicaca. This last information supports the case for contact with Tiahuanaco. ","(-27.112723, -109.3496865)",-27.112723,-109.3496865,"Easter Island is situated in the middle of the Pacific   Ocean, and was one of the primary islands of the Polynesian Island group.
Hundreds of stone statues or 'Maoi' lie scattered around the island, and   encircle it on long raised platforms.
Recent studies however suggest that the islanders were masters of their environment and the collapse actually occurred 'following' European contact.
A Brief History.The reigning consensus is that Easter Island was colonized around 300-400 AD as part of an eastward migratory trend that originated in Southeast Asia around 2000 BC.
The Frenchman La Pï¿½rouse visited Easter Island in 1786 and found the population calm and prosperous, suggesting a quick recovery from any catastrophe.
Accounts from subsequent years suggest another period of destruction so that perhaps only a handful of statues were still standing a decade later.
100 survivors were later returned, of which 15 reached their homes (carrying smallpox), which almost finished the population of the island.(1) South Americans helped colonise Easter Island centuries before Europeans reached it.
Clear genetic evidence has, for the first time, given support to elements of this controversial theory showing that while the remote island was mostly colonised from the west, there was also some influx of people from the Americas.
The various lines of evidence suggest people began migrating east around 5500 years ago, reached Polynesia 2500 years later, before finally gaining Easter Island after another 1500 years.
In the mid-20th century, he claimed that the famous Easter Island statues were similar to those at Tiahuanaco at Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, so people from South America must have travelled west across the Pacific to Polynesia.
Thorsby found that in some cases the Polynesian and American HLA genes were shuffled together, the result of a process known ï¿½recombinationï¿½.
Thorsby canï¿½t put a precise date on it, but says it is likely that Americans reached Easter Island before it was ï¿½discoveredï¿½ by Europeans in 1722.
ï¿½Heyerdahl was wrong,ï¿½ Thorsby says, ï¿½but not completely.ï¿½  Easter Island is perhaps best known for its immense stone statues'Moai', of which there are approximately 900 scattered across the island.
Some of the Maoi were placed, facing towards the centre of the island, on platforms called 'Ahu', built along the coasts.
All the giant statues on Easter Island have long ears, and some islanders still practised ear elongation at the time the first Europeans arrived.
The oldest known practice of ear extension was among the mariners in the prehistoric Indus Valley harbour-city of Lothal, where large numbers of big earplugs of the type used in ancient Mexico, Peru, and Easter Island have been found.
Buddha images with long ears are found all over Asia, and long-eared stone statues have also been dug up in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.
his contention is that they were all destined to eventually encircle the whole island onAhu. The statues at the crater are scattered around in a random manner, whereas the statues at theahu, when they were still standing, were perfectly aligned and in a group.
Although the giant statues appear scattered haphazardly, they actually form three major groups on the inner slope of the crater, facing north, such that they all have their backs to the face of the volcanic rock from which they were carved.
The following statistics on Easter Island's moai are the results of Van Tilburg's survey in 1989.
She reported, ""A total of 887 monolithic statues has been located by the survey to date on Easter Island...397 are still in situ in quarries at the Rano Raraku central production centre.....Fully 288 statues (32% of 887) were successfully transported to a variety of image ahu locations....Another 92 are recorded as ""in transport,"" 47 of these lying in various positions on prepared roads or tracks outside the Rano Raraku zone."" Less than one third of all carved moai actually made it to a final ceremonial ahu site.
Were they originally intended to remain in place on the quarry slopes?
There were clearly some very large stones carved on this island, and a When proof was found in 1978 that   some of the Easter Island statues once had inlaid eyes, it came as a   shock to many researchers, who had opposed the idea on the grounds   that this was not a Polynesian custom.
Many prehistoric American stone statues   also had inlaid eyes.
In the Ahu Vinapu and in the fragment of theahunear Hangaroa beach the stones are as colossal as in the old Temple of the Sun in Cuzco, they are as carefully tooled, and the irregularities of their sides that have to come together are so cut that the two faces exactly fit into each other.
Astronomically oriented ahu along the coast tend to be positioned so that the moai look straight east or west.

Two stones are carved with axes and a yoke, and one of the uprights' packing stones has nine cup-marks (according to Le Rouzic, arranged to form the outline of the constellation Ursa Major).

"Eridu, Iraq",Sumerian City State,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/iraqeridu.htm,"Eridu, Sumeria","The ruins, in which Taylor conducted brief excavations, consist of a    platform of fine sand enclosed by a sandstone wall, 20 ft. high, the corners orientated toward the    cardinal points, on the N.W. part of which was a pyramidal tower of two stages, constructed of sun-dried brick, cased with a wall of kiln-burned brick, the whole still standing to a height of about 70 ft. above the platform. The summit of the first stage was reached by a    staircase on the S.E. side, 15 ft. wide and 70 ft. long, constructed of polished marble slabs, fastened with copper bolts, flanked at the foot by two curious columns. An inclined road led up to the second stage on the N.W. side. Pieces of polished    alabaster and marble, with small pieces of pure gold and gold-headed copper nails, found on and about the top of the second stage, indicated that a small but richly adorned sacred chamber, apparently plated within or without in gold, formerly crowned the top of this structure. Around the whole tower was a    pavement of inscribed baked bricks, resting on a layer of clay 2 ft. thick. On the S.E. part of the    terrace were the remains of several edifices, containing suites of rooms. Inscriptions on the bricks identified the site as that of Eridu. Eridu is best known for its temples, called ziggurats. The earliest temple, dated to the Ubaid period about 5570 BC, consisted of a small room with a possible cult niche and an offering table. After a break, there are ever-larger temples built and rebuilt on this site throughout its history. Each of these temples was built with classical early Mesopotamian format of tripartite plan, with a buttressed facade and a long central room with an altar. The Ziggurat of Enki was built for the Third Dynasty of Ur, 3,000 years after the city's founding. The lowest building   levels at Eridu (XVIII to XV), revealed small houses and shrines built of mud-brick to rectangular plans. This phase dates back to 5,000 BC.(1) The next phase (Hajji   Muhammed), began about 4,750 BC and occupies five building levels. This phase was well represented across southern Mesopotamia. It develops into the third phase.(1) The third phase of   development was named after the site Al 'Ubaid'. The Ubaid people spread across the whole of Mesopotamia. They used gold and copper and casted axes(1) The Ubaid were   succeeded by the Uruk phase which lasted from around 3,800 - 3,200 BC. The first evidence of writing was discovered at this level.(1) According to the biblical   account, a united humanity of the generations following theGreat Flood, speaking a single language and migrating from the east, participated in the building. The people decided their city should have a tower so immense that it would have ""its top in the heavens"".(3) However, the Tower of Babel was   not built for the worship and praise of God, but was instead dedicated   to the glory of man, to ""make a name"" for the builders: ""Then they   said, 'Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower with its top   in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves; otherwise we   shall be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.'"" (Genesis   11:4). God, seeing what the people were doing, came down and confused   their languages and scattered the people throughout the earth. The ziggurat ruins of Eridu are far larger and older than any   others, and seem to best match the Biblical description of the   unfinished Tower of Babel. One name of Eridu in cuneiform logograms was pronounced ""NUN.KI""   (""the Mighty Place"") in Sumerian, but much later the same ""NUN.KI"" was   understood to mean the city of Babylon. The much later Greek version of the King-list by Berosus (c. 200   BC) reads ""Babylon"" in place of ""Eridu"" in the earlier versions, as   the name of the oldest city where ""the kingship was lowered from   Heaven"".

In Sumerian mythology, it was said to be one of the five cities built before the Deluge occurred. Eridu appears to be the earliest settlement in the region, founded ca. 5400 BC, close to the Persian Gulf near the mouth of the Euphrates River. Because of accumulation of silt at the shoreline over the millennia, the remains of Eridu are now some distance from the gulf at Abu Shahrain in Iraq.

"Evora, Portugal",Megalithic Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portoevora.htm,"Megalithic Evora, Portugal","The concentration of megaliths around Evora have given the region the title of the 'Iberian Mesopotamia'. The area contains a diverse selection of megaliths, and boasts  cave-art (Arte Rupeste), dating back to the Palaeolithic period in theGruta do Escoural. As well as having one of the oldest and largest stone-circles in Europe (Almendres), and the passage-mound with the largest stones in Europe (Zambujeiro),    the region around Evora includes some of the best examples of megaliths  in Portugal, if not all Iberia. Evora has been continuously occupied for the last 20,000 years(1),  with some of the sites showing signs of re-use (such as at Almendres). The significance of Evora is evident through its continued use over such a long period of time, proving it to be one of the most important megalithic locations in Iberia. In the case of Evora, it can be seen that it is located on one of only two latitudes in the world at which, in some nights of the year, you get the full moon on the zenith. The other latitude is 51ï¿½ 10' N, the same asStonehenge.  The Almendres stone circle   has been shown to have both Equinoctial and Solstice   orientations and alignments, involving the nearby Menhir dos   Almendres and other sites. It is dated from the 5th to the 4th   Millennium B.C.  (Ref: Site Plaque), and still has   visible engravings and designs visible on some of the stones. This   amazing passage mound rivals any in Europe. Although it has   been quarried heavily over the years, this has resulted in the   exposure of the inside structure, giving it the unique   appearance it has today.The seven smoothed upright stones inside the Zambujeiro passage mound are the largest in all Europe. The enormous cap-stone, now lies in pieces at the top and has the appearance of either having been removed and broken, or having been broken in the process of construction. Many of the artefacts discovered here are now on view at the Museum of Evora.The stones extend over 7m above ground and the whole construction was covered by with a mound on-par withMaes-howeor the Irish passage-mounds at theBoyne Valley.The style of the structure is unique to  Portugal, being the only true passage mound,   originally covering the whole of the internal stone structure.Zambujeiro is one of Portugal's treasures and a must for all lovers of megaliths.(More about Zumbujeiro) The seven smoothed upright stones inside the Zambujeiro passage mound are the largest in all Europe.

It was used repeatedly between 35,000 -   8,000 BC, and again in the Neolithic as a funerary chamber There are   over 100 engravings and paintings in the caves from the   Palaeolithic period making it one of the most significant cave   systems in Portugal. There are two different types of images   in the caves;   some of a zoomorphic nature such as bovines and horses, and   the others abstract and geometric. The latitude is significant as it is only at this particular latitude   and one other (i.e. Stonehenge) at which the full moon can be seen on   the zenith at certain nights of the year. The specific location of two   of the largest Stone-circles in Europe at both of the latitudes where   this is possible suggests an element of deliberation on the part of   the builders. Cromleque dos   Almendres: Apart from being orientated to mark the Equinoxes, a   line from the upper edge of the circle to the nearby Menhir dos   Almendres,   follows the same path as the winter solstice sun. It is also suggested that the number of stones in the   original circle (91) may have been used to measure the number of days   between solstices (182).(2)  Both theAlmendrescircle and theZambujeiropassage-mound belong to an alignment of   sites which continues eastwards to the 'Cromeleque' da Xarez, around   50km away. The alignment is suggested to have a lunar significance,   corresponding to the azimuth of the spring full-moon (110ï¿½), which is   close enough to the equinox to have served as a marker (5). It is probably no   coincidence that the Anta Grande da Zambujeiro was orientated to face   the same direction. One of the most basic components of many of the European megalithic complexes is the presence of a prominent mound, often suggested as symbolising the 'mound of creation', and usually in the form of a passage mound, alongside a stone circle. These two structures appear to be a basic component in several European complexes. While there are regional variations on this theme, the two components can be seen to appear together at several important sites, such as: Avebury/Silbury, the Orkneys complex (Maes-Howe/Stennes), Gavr'inis/Er Lannic in France and noticeably, Ggantija/Xagra, on Malta. At Evora, these requirements are met in the shape of theZambujeiroPassage mound and theAlmendresStone circle, both the largest of their kind in Iberia.

The significance of Evora is evident through its continued use over such a long period of time, proving it to be one of the most important megalithic locations in Iberia.
In the case of Evora, it can be seen that it is located on one of only two latitudes in the world at which, in some nights of the year, you get the full moon on the zenith.
The Almendres stone circle   has been shown to have both Equinoctial and Solstice   orientations and alignments, involving the nearby Menhir dos   Almendres and other sites.
Although it has   been quarried heavily over the years, this has resulted in the   exposure of the inside structure, giving it the unique   appearance it has today.The seven smoothed upright stones inside the Zambujeiro passage mound are the largest in all Europe.

"Floating Island, Greece","Delos, Oracle Centre",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/greecedelos.htm,"Delos, Greece","One of the most important mythological, historical and archaeological sites in Greece. Indeed, its location at the centre of the Cyclades gives rise to the theory that the name of the Cyclades group of islands in the Aegean sea comes from the word, circle or 'kyklos' that form around the island of Delos. As well as being an important archaeological site, Delos is connected geometrically with other important Greek sites and is a part of the 'oracle  octave' as proposed by Livvio Stecchini. Delos, along with many of the Greek islandswas first occupied sometime during the 3rd millennium BCE (5). The importance of the island is made clear in Greek mythology, where it is said to be the birthplace of Apollo, although it functioned as a religious location and sanctuary long before the Greeks decreed it the birthplace of two of their most important gods.A number of ""purifications"" were executed by the city-state of Athens in an attempt to render the island fit for the proper worship of the Gods. The first took place in the 6th century BC, and was directed by Pisistratus, who ordered that all graves within sight of the temple be dug up and the bodies moved to another nearby island. Such was the importance of the island that    In the 5th century, during the 6th year of the Peloponnesian war and under instruction from the Delphic Oracle, the entire island was purged of all dead bodies and it was decreed Evidence of the first inhabitants of the island is thought to have occurred around 2,800-2,500 B.C. Excavations have discovered the ruins of this pre-historic settlement on the top of the low hill of Mount Kynthos. The island reached its climax in the archaic (7th-8th century B.C.) and classical (5th -4th centuries B.C.) period after Hellenes from all over the ancient Greek world gathered there to worship the twin god and goddess Apollo and Artemis, completing the prophesy by Leto. For much of its history, the island was a thriving commercial port with population estimates onward to a staggering 30,000 people. Under the Romans in the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C. as many as 10,000 slaves were said to be sold there on some days. The prosperity of Delos reached an end, following the attack by Mithridates of Pontus, a monarch from Asia Minor, who went to war with Rome and conquered the island in 88 B.C., slaughtered its 20,000 inhabitants, and sailed away with ships loaded with the treasures of the island.(3) According to mythology, Leto, pursued by the incensed and jealous goddess Hera, wandered from place to place seeking some corner of the earth in which to give birth to her children, the fruit of her union with Zeus, father of the Gods. But all the Islands and cities refused to receive her, afraid of the vengeance of Zeus' deceived consort, whom only a bare rock in the middle of the tempestuous sea dared to defy. Prior to this event, the island had floated aimlessly in the Aegean, but became anchored in its position by Poseidon who made four granite columns rise out of the sea to anchor it firmly in its present place for the divine birth. This is why the island came to be called Delos, which means 'visible', before which it was a floating, nomadic rock called Ortygia or Adelos (the invisible). It is said that it was on Delos that Leto finally bore the twins, Apollo and Artemis under a palm.In return for the sanctuary of the island, she promised that the god she was about to give birth to would turn this dry and barren island into a place of great pilgrimage and bring prosperity to its land. It is interesting that Herodoyus made mention of a 'floating island' named Khemmis, at Buto in Egypt (2.156) where Isis is said to have given birth to Horus. On this island there is a Temple of Leto (Wadjet), and also a temple to Apollo, but Herodotus dismissed the claim that it floated as merely the legend of Delos brought to Egypt from Greek tradition. The Romans called Leto ""Latona"". Note too that theOsireionat Abydoss, contained an artificial floating 'island', associated with Isis through Osiris. As well as the thriving slave market and busy harbour port, the island supported a large residential quarters and extensive temples, shrines and centres of purification. In addition, the island's profile was maintained through the Delian Festivals and Games which were held there every 4 years (with a 6,000 - seat amphitheatre still present). It is indeed remarkable thatthe island was capable of sustaining such prosperity in light of the fact that it has never had any productive capacity for food, timber, and limited natural water sources. What water was naturally available, such as rain water was exploited with an fantastic extensive cistern and aqueduct system, wells, and sanitary drains. (water tanks are still present with capacities of 27,000 litres) The oracle of Apollo on Delos was only consulted when Apollo made Delos his 'summer residence', for his winter abode was said to be at Patara, a city of Lycia. The temple of Apollo, was, according to Strabo, (lib. x.) begun by Erysiapthus, the son of Cecrops, who is said to have possessed this island 1558 years B. C.; but it was afterwards much enlarged and embellished at the general charge of all the Grecian states. But Plutarch says, that is was one of the most stately buildings in the universe, and describes its altar, as deserving a place among the seven wonders of the world. The inscription in this temple, as Aristotle informs us, (Ethic. I. i. c. 9.) was as follows: ""Of all things the most beautiful is justice; the most useful is health; and the most agreeable is the possession of the beloved object."" Travelling to Delphi in the late 1950s, Jean Richer, professor of literature with a special interest in symbolism, wondered about the connection between Delphi, site of Apollo's main sanctuary and oracle, and Delos, the god's traditional birthplace, as well as Delphi's relationship with Athena, so prominently represented at the sanctuary. While in Athens, insight came in a dream: a figure of Apollo, facing directly away from him, turned slowly through 180 degrees to face him. Awaking, he found a map and drew a straight line joining Delphi, Athens, and Delos, revealing a spatial relationship among these sacred sites. Over several years Richer continued finding alignments by drawing lines on the map which formed geometric figures, many of which obviously represented projections or correspondences on earth of celestial objects and directions. In fact, ""it quickly became clear that the Greeks, like the ancient Mesopotamians and the Egyptians, had wanted to make their country a living image of the heavens."" He soon became convinced that Greece had been divided into twelve sectors corresponding to the twelve signs of the zodiac, with Delphi as the centre oromphalos, the ""navel"" of the Greek mainland. Examining art and artefacts from cities and temples in the pie-shaped sectors, Richer found that, far from containing arbitrary decorations, the images predominantly related to the seasons, solstices, cardinal points, and zodiacal signs corresponding to their particular sector of the Delphic ""zodiac."" Further investigation revealed a second zodiacal wheel centred on Delos, which furnished the Aegean islands with sacred celestial directions and correspondences; and a third, older wheel also centred on Sardis, capital of Lydia (in present-day Turkey), a city on the same latitude as Delphi. Finally, he found a still more ancient system centred on Ammoneion in the Libyan desert, home of the oracle of Ammon. It shared the north-south axis or 'meridian' with Delos and included such objects as the Sphinx at Giza in its sectors.

The Construction-The chambered mound on thesmall island of Gavr'inis now lies about 500m off the Brittany coast, and is today only accessible  by boat.

"Ghiza/Giza, Egypt","Pyramid Complex, Sphinx",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/egyptghiza.htm,"The Giza Plateau, Egypt","R The 1984 ""David H. Koch Pyramids Radiocarbon Project"" took organic material from several places in the core of the Great Pyramid as well as other 4th Dynasty pyramids and locations so as to try and date their radiocarbon. This yielded results averaging 374 years earlier than the date accepted by egyptologists but much more recent than 10,000 years ago. A second dating in 1995 with new but similar material obtained dates ranging between 100-400 years earlier than those indicated by the historic record. This raised interesting questions concerning the origin and date of the wood. Massive quantities of wood were used and burned, so to reconcile the earlier dates the authors of the study theorize that possibly ""old wood"" was used, assuming that wood was harvested from any source available, including old construction material from all over Egypt. It is also known that King Sneferu imported wood from Lebanon. Project scientists based their conclusions on the evidence that some of the material in the 3rd Dynasty pyramid of Pharaoh Djoser and other monuments had been recycled, concluding that the construction of the pyramids marked a a major depletion of Egypt's exploitable wood. Dating of more short-lived material around the pyramid (cloth, small fires, etc) yielded dates nearer to those indicated by historical records. The authors insist more evidence is need to settle this issue. This study does not sufficiently address key anomalies in its findings, however - mainly how and where the Egyptians were able to obtain literally tons of 100-400 year old dead wood. Even preserved in a desert climate, finding forests of such magnitude comprised of ancient dead wood would be a phenomenon in and of itself. It is believed Egypt's climate would have only been able to support such a forest (though there is no evidence of one having existed at the time being largely grasslands) at the latest only prior to 4,000-6,000 BC. For this to be true an entire revision of Egypt's climatic history would be required. When considering the data, what is shown is the radio carbon of the pyramids yielded dates ranging from 100-400 years earlier than the ""historical record"", yet the signs of last casual occupation, ie. cloth, small fires, etc, have given dates much closer to what is expected from egyptologists. Instead of requiring a revision of Egypt's climatic history based solely on the fact these dates do not support accepted theory despite supporting climatology data to the contrary, it is equally possible that what the study suggests is true--that the pyramids are indeed older (if only by 100-400 years) than what is currently believed. Mortensen In the mid 1970's, Karl Kromer, investigated one such area of debris, approximately one kilometre south of the Great Pyramid. (48) Within the fill, Kromer reported finds from the Late Pre-dynastic, 1st, 2nd and 4th Dynasties.  It is believed by Egyptologists that the majority of the large 'Memphite' pyramids', were built over a period of three generations (With only 60 years between the completion of the 1st dynasty step pyramid of Djoser and the the beginning of the 4th dynasty pyramids of Giza) Although we cannot see it today, the Giza plateau remained essentially as it was built for thousands of years. The level of skills demonstrated there were so high that for a long time it was believed that the pyramids were 'divine creations' made literally by god. The debate today centres around the family of the Fourth dynasty Pharaohs in particular who, whilst no longer being doubted as having a strong association with the complex, present themselves to us so suddenly and uniquely as to cause us to search deep within ourselves to explain the origin, nature and purpose of these people. The Fourth dynasty pharaohs are currently believed to be the result of an extremely rapid and dramatic rise to power in Egypt, following unification around 60 years before. This centralisation apparently initiated the development of several seemingly instantaneous sophisticated skills in the process. The development of all the large '  Khufu:This is the only cartouche,(And therefore the only direct evidence of Khufu's involvement with the Great pyraimd).This cartouche (right), was found on the southern roof blocks of Campbell's chamber in the 'Great' pyramid, as was another cartouche  which is translated as 'Khnum-Khuf',found on the south wall of 'Lady Arbuthnot's' chamber(10). The same two Hieroglyphs have been found alongside each other elsewhere in Egypt. A situation which has generated speculation over their meaning. Petrie said of this situation: 'The only great royal inscription (of Khufu) is on the rocks of Sinai. There are two tablets: one with the name and titles of Khufu, the other with the king smiting an enemy, and the name Khnum-khufu The name is found in five places The two names being placed in succession in one inscription cannot be mere chance variants of the same. Either they must be two distinct and independent names of one king, or else two separate kings. If they were separate kings,Khnum-khuf must have been the most important. Other 4th dynasty finds: In 1955, two dismantled wooden boats were found buried beside the Great Pyramid beneath stones bearing Djedefre's name (Khafre's brother). The sarcophagus and funerary furniture of Queen Hetepheres I, the mother of Khufu, was discovered in 1925 near the satellite pyramids of the Great pyramid in shaft G700X of a pit tomb. It was in good condition and most of the contents were intact. Although the sarcophagus was sealed, and the canopic jars were intact, Hetepheres' mummy was missing. These are the oldest examples of canopic jars known. While there is little debate at present over who built the pyramids, there is a visible change in the design and quality between the the first dynasty and the fourth (Such as Flat sided pyramids, Cardinal orientation,  Polar passages,  Lack of adornment and funerary remains). The combination of these particular construction features have no precedent in Egypt and it is worth looking at the source of the historical record which suggests an immigration into Egypt at this time of a people as yet unidentified beyond their title of 'Shepherd Folk'.  The Greek historian Herodotus passed on what he was told by Egyptian priests: The following interpretation adequately describes the now famous conversation between Herodotus and Manetho. -'In the course of his questioning he(Herodotus)encountered one Manetho, an Egyptian High Priest, scholar and Historian, with whom he conversed at length thru the agency of an interpreter. Manetho informed his distinguished guest that the architect of the huge mass of stone was one ""Philition"", or ""Suphis"", of a people known as the ""Hyksos"", that is ""Shepherd Kings"". According to Manetho, the Shepherd Kings were ""a people of ignoble race"" who came from some unknown land in theEast; they were a nomadic band who numbered not less than 280,000 souls; they brought with them their families and all mobile possessions, including vast flocks of sheep and herds of cattle; and they ""had the confidence to invade Egypt, and subdued it without a battle"". this same people, said Manetho, overthrew the then-reigning Dynasty, stamped out idolatry and endeavoured to firmly establish in the place thereof the worship of the One true God having completed the Great pyramid, migrated eastward into the land afterwards known as Judea and founded there the city of Salem, which later became Jerusalem, the Holy city.' Who were the Shepherd folk? The following extract is from Seiss Several constructions on the Giza plateau were built under the auspices of the Fourth dynasty pharaohs Khafre, Khufu and Menkaure. This has been firmly established through the historical record and subsequent discoveries of cartouches at the site. However, the discoveries of cartouches and funerary evidence from earlier dynasties (see above), clearly suggests that parts of the the site may have been Khafre's pyramid stands equal in height to the great pyramid, although it is actually smaller - this is due to its being built on higher ground. Although the majority of books discuss the 'mysteries' surrounding the 'great' pyramid,  Khafre's has certain features that make it equally unique. Not only does it sit at the geometric centre of the site, it is also attached to the Sphinx by a causeway, although this causeway runs over other tombs suggesting it was a later addition.    The blue basalt coffer which was taken from the pyramid was lost at sea a year later in 1838. A joint Egyptian/Spanish initiative is currently underway to retrieve it. In 'The Great Pyramid Decoded, Peter Lemesurier writes, ""It would be a rash man who undertook to find, even today, a building more accurately aligned to the True cardinal points of the compass, masonry more finely jointed, or facing-stones more immaculately dressed.... the sceptic may doubt that many of the pyramid's stones -- some of them weighing up to seventy tons -- were so finely cut and positioned as to give joints of less than a fiftieth of an inch in thickness'; '...he may scoff at the claim that a fine cement was run into these joints so expertly as to give an even coverage of single areas as big as five feet by sevenin the vertical; he may express profound disbelief when it is pointed out to him that the building's now almost totally despoiled original outer casing of polished limestone (all twenty-one acres of it) was levelled and honed to the standard of accuracy normal in modern optical work. But these, as it happens, are facts which anybody may check who cares to'. This superb structure is without comparison at Giza. It has no other contemporaneous building in Egypt except perhaps theOsireionat Abydoss (Which shows stark similarities).The causeway that leads from Khafre's pyramid leads to the Sphinx on one side, and the Valley temple on the other. The valley temple was constructed with immense blocks of granite, surrounded by a wall of even larger blocks of limestone, the largest estimated to weigh approximately 200 tons. Of particular interest is the early-dynastic history of the unification of 'upper' and 'lower' Egypt and the primal Egyptian myth of Osiris and Isis, in relation to these temples.  These temples suggest a commonality, whilst adhering to the theme of the Isis/Osiris myths. The Osireion is associated with Osiris, and the Valley temple to Isis, his consort, sister and mother. The Ghiza pyramids are cardinally orientated (equinoxially), while the great temples in the south of Egypt such as Karnack, Denderra and The Temple of Seti (Osireion), are orientated to the solstices. The symbolic act of unification, was not only concerned with the physical boundaries of  Egypt,  but also the solar year. The 'Kings' Chamber:   It has been frequently suggested in the past that there is a connection between the two sites, an idea which archaeologists and historians have (reasonable) difficulty accepting. One of the primary observations has been that the latitude of Stonehenge is the same as the exterior angle of the great pyramid of Khufu. In itself of course, this is not enough to substantiate such a theory but when one looks closer at the two sites, other geometric/geodetic facts emerge which  The exterior angle of Khufu's pyramid is 51ï¿½ 51', which in geometric terms is (360/7) x 4 or ( The exterior angle of Khafre's pyramid is 53ï¿½10', which is (almost exactly) angle formed by a 3:4:5 triangle. Khafre's pyramid is attached to the Sphinx via a causeway that runs 30ï¿½ off true East. The exterior angle of  Khafre's pyramid is the same as the latitude ofArbor Low, which sits exactly 2ï¿½ north of Stonehenge. It is a well known fact that the N/S axis of the Khufu (Cheops) is only 03' 06"" to the west of true north, a fact which confirms the levels of skill/accuracy attained by the ancient Egyptian astronomers (and builders). In the common opinion of Egyptologists, the small pyramids next to the great pyramid of Khufu served as burial places for the relatives of the Pharaoh. Certain facts, which have not been previously considered, indicate that there is a chance that the pyramids ï¿½ due to their ground plan arrangement ï¿½ are not only burial places but also the components of a yearly calendar. Research by the Hungarian architect Andrï¿½sGï¿½czey has demonstrated that there are clear alignments between Khufu's pyramid and the three smaller burial pyramids of his relatives. The Basic Principles of the 'Khufu Calendar' are as follows: ","(30.00256019999999, 31.1766037)",30.00256019999999,31.1766037,"Massive quantities of wood were used and burned, so to reconcile the earlier dates the authors of the study theorize that possibly ""old wood"" was used, assuming that wood was harvested from any source available, including old construction material from all over Egypt.
Project scientists based their conclusions on the evidence that some of the material in the 3rd Dynasty pyramid of Pharaoh Djoser and other monuments had been recycled, concluding that the construction of the pyramids marked a a major depletion of Egypt's exploitable wood.
Dating of more short-lived material around the pyramid (cloth, small fires, etc) yielded dates nearer to those indicated by historical records.
When considering the data, what is shown is the radio carbon of the pyramids yielded dates ranging from 100-400 years earlier than the ""historical record"", yet the signs of last casual occupation, ie.
Instead of requiring a revision of Egypt's climatic history based solely on the fact these dates do not support accepted theory despite supporting climatology data to the contrary, it is equally possible that what the study suggests is true--that the pyramids are indeed older (if only by 100-400 years) than what is currently believed.
The debate today centres around the family of the Fourth dynasty Pharaohs in particular who, whilst no longer being doubted as having a strong association with the complex, present themselves to us so suddenly and uniquely as to cause us to search deep within ourselves to explain the origin, nature and purpose of these people.
The Fourth dynasty pharaohs are currently believed to be the result of an extremely rapid and dramatic rise to power in Egypt, following unification around 60 years before.
Other 4th dynasty finds: In 1955, two dismantled wooden boats were found buried beside the Great Pyramid beneath stones bearing Djedefre's name (Khafre's brother).
The sarcophagus and funerary furniture of Queen Hetepheres I, the mother of Khufu, was discovered in 1925 near the satellite pyramids of the Great pyramid in shaft G700X of a pit tomb.
The combination of these particular construction features have no precedent in Egypt and it is worth looking at the source of the historical record which suggests an immigration into Egypt at this time of a people as yet unidentified beyond their title of 'Shepherd Folk'.
this same people, said Manetho, overthrew the then-reigning Dynasty, stamped out idolatry and endeavoured to firmly establish in the place thereof the worship of the One true God having completed the Great pyramid, migrated eastward into the land afterwards known as Judea and founded there the city of Salem, which later became Jerusalem, the Holy city.' Who were the Shepherd folk?
The following extract is from Seiss Several constructions on the Giza plateau were built under the auspices of the Fourth dynasty pharaohs Khafre, Khufu and Menkaure.
However, the discoveries of cartouches and funerary evidence from earlier dynasties (see above), clearly suggests that parts of the the site may have been Khafre's pyramid stands equal in height to the great pyramid, although it is actually smaller - this is due to its being built on higher ground.

The primeval mound (surrounded by water) was a fundamental theme in prehistory, and Glastonbury was surrounded by water until the Somerset flats were drained in the 4th century. The  discovery of lake-villages and raised walkways connecting Glastonbury with the landscape illustrates that the hill was considered worthy of attention since prehistoric times. Glastonbury Tor is  known as the 'Heart of England', revealing a spiritual connection that has been reinforced by association with the Arthurian legend of Avalon, and we are reminded by John Michell that Glastonbury was mentioned in the 'Welsh Triads' as one of ancient Britain's 'Perpetual Choirs'.(2) 705 AD-    King Ine founded a monastery here, which became a Benedictine house in the 10thCentury. 1184 AD - 1190 AD - 1278 AD - TheAbbey Church was built in the 13thand 14thcenturies, of which substantial remains still exist. 1539 AD- The Tor was the place of execution of the last Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, who was hanged, drawn and quartered along with two of his monks.

Legend tells how the shaft of the well was built of huge stones by the druids and that later, the Chalice used at the ï¿½last supperï¿½ (the Holy Grail), was thrown into its waters. Sir Norman Lockyer noted that the style of construction was similar to that seen in ancient Egypt.    Archaeo-Astronomy -  Alignments - It is interesting to note that Glastonbury (and the orientation of the tower on top) liesin-linewith the St. Michaels Ley, making it a compelling suggestion that the hill was artificially shaped into its present form, an idea which finds favour in the seven-levelled ritual terraced pathway that winds up the Tor. This is suggested to have been a deliberate pathway, either designed to entrap passing spirits, which were believed to travel in straight lines (Ley-lines) or, as a ritual pathway (Labyrinth) for pilgrims. Navigating the inland sea at Glastonbury- The so-called ï¿½Sweet Trackï¿½, was discovered in 1970. It extended across the marsh between what was then an island at Westhay, and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, spanning a distance of almost two kilometres. It is clear that this area was once thus engineered so that it could be passed on foot. It is now known that this was but one of a network of such tracks. Today, the Sweet Track has the honour of being the oldest engineered road in the world and the oldest timber trackway in Northern Europe. Tree-ring dating has concluded that it was built in ca. 3800 BC. The track consisted of crossed poles of ash, oak and lime, which were driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that mainly consisted of oak planks laid end-to-end. Since its discovery in 1970, it has been determined that the Sweet Track was actually built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, dating from ca. 3840 BC. According to accounts by the chronicler, Giraldus Cambrensis, the abbot, Henry de Sully, commissioned a search, discovering at the depth of 16 feet (5 m) a massive hollowed oak trunk containing two skeletons. Above it, under the covering stone, according to Giraldus, was a leaden cross with the unmistakably specific inscription Hic jacet sepultus inclitus rex Arthurus in insula Avalonia (""Here lies interred the famous King Arthur on the Isle of Avalon"").

"Gobekli Tepe, Turkey",Oldest known Stone Circles,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/turkeygobekli.htm,"Gobekli Tepe, Turkey","This is the site of the worlds currently known oldest shrine or temple complex in the world, and the planet's oldest known example of monumental architecture. It has also produced the oldest known life-size figure of a human. Compared to Stonehenge, Carnac or the Pyramids of Egypt, these are relatively humble megaliths. None of the circles excavated (four out of anestimated 20) are more than 30 meters across. What makes the discovery remarkable are both the exquisite and intricate carvings of boars, foxes, lions, birds, snakes and scorpions, and their age. Dated at around 9,500 BC, these stones are 5,500 years older than the first cities of Mesopotamia. Description-As there is no evidence of habitation; the structures are interpreted as temples. After 8000 BC, the site was abandoned and purposely covered up with soil.(1)It is thought that the hill top was a site of pilgrimage for communities within a radius of roughly a hundred miles. The tallest stones all face southeast, In the Jan. 18 issue of the   journal'Science', German archaeologist Klaus   Schmidt is interviewed about his work at the 11,000-year-old site of   Gobekli Tepe (""navel hill"") in Turkey. According to Andrew Curry, the   author of theSciencearticle, Gobekli Tepe   is situated on the most prominent hilltop for miles around. It   consists of at least 20 underground rooms that contain a number of   T-shaped stone pillars that are 8 feet tall and weigh about 7 tons.   The pillars are engraved with images of animals, including leopards,   snakes and spiders. This is not a place where people   lived. It's as far away from water as you can get in this region.   Instead, it's a place of ceremony. And, according to Schmidt, it's   ""the first manmade holy place."" ""This place is as important as the discovery of 14,000 B.C. cave art in France,"" says Harald Hauptmann, the team leader and director of the German Archaeological Institute in Istanbul. Gobekli Tepe reflects what the experts say is a turning point from the Epi-paleolithic to the Early Neolithic era in upper Mesopotamia - that is, the time when early man was just beginning to control nature, before the advent of food production, until the first domestication of plants and animals'. 'Two of them bear the image of a snarling lion defending what Hauptmann believes to be a cult sanctuary or shrine. Erected without the aid of domesticated animals 6,000 years before giant structures were built in Pharaohic Egypt, the pillars suggest that early Neolithic workers knew how to use poles, boards and pulleys to handle huge stones'. Hauptmann's site also features a unique floor relief of a squatting woman--perhaps giving birth--reliefs of a variety of animals, and a field of flint chips, indicating the site also hosted a fairly sophisticated tool- and weapon-producing operation. 'The houses or temples are round   megalithic buildings. The walls are made of unworked dry stone and   include numerous T-shaped monolithic pillars of limestone that are up   to 3 m high. Another, bigger pair of pillars is placed in the centre   of the structure. The floors are made of Terrazzo (burnt lime), and   there is a low bench running along the whole of the exterior wall'. 'The reliefs on the pillars   include foxes, lions, cattle, wild boars, herons, ducks, scorpions,   ants and snakes. Some of the reliefs have been deliberately erased,   maybe in preparation for new pictures. There are freestanding   sculptures as well that may represent wild boars or foxes. As they are   heavily encrusted with lime, it is sometimes difficult to tell.   Comparable statues have been discovered inNevalı ï¿½ori. The   quarries for the statues are located on the plateau itself, some   unfinished pillars have been found there in-situ. The biggest   unfinished pillar is still 6.9 m long, a length of 9m has been   reconstructed'. 'The construction of the Gï¿½bekli   Tepe complex implies organisation of a degree of complexity not   hitherto associated with pre-Neolithic societies. The archaeologists   estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the 10-20 ton   pillars (in fact, some weigh up to 50 tons) from local quarries and   move them 100 to 500m to the site'.(Ref:  http://en.wikipedia.org/) So far, 40-odd standing stones (two to four metres   high) have been dug out. They are T-shaped and arranged in enclosed   circles, which cover several hundred square metres. However, a broken,   half-quarried stone has been found in a limestone bed about a   kilometre from the main site. It is nine metres long, and was   obviously intended to join the pillars at Gobekli: so there may be   other stones, as yet unearthed, that are this big. Geomagnetic surveys   imply that there are at least 250 more standing stones buried at the   site.  Around the beginning of the 8th   millennium BC, ""Navel Mountain"" lost its importance. The advent of   agriculture and animal husbandry brought new circumstances to human   life in the area. But the complex was not gradually abandoned and   simply forgotten, to be obliterated by the forces of nature over time.   Instead, it was deliberately covered with 300 to 500 cubic metres of   soil. Why this happened is unknown, but it preserved the monuments for   posterity. The most recent building phase at Gï¿½bekli Tepe (Level II) has been dated both comparatively and absolutely (C14) to ca 8,000 BC, with an earlier primary building phase (Level III) ending as early as 9,000 BC. The age of the earliest occupation cannot yet be determined; the depth of the deposit, however, would suggest a period of several millennia, which signifies that the site had already existed in early Palaeolithic times.

Gors Fawr,"Stone Circle, Avenue",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/walesgorsfawr.htm,"Gors Fawr, Wales","The sitting of this circle is particularly interesting as it lies just to the south of the Preseli Mountains - these hills being the place where the Stonehenge bluestones originated. Despite this close proximity to the source of these obviously sacred stones, only half were used in the making of this circle, the rest are composed of local glacial erratic boulders. 'This near-perfect circle of sixteen stones measuring about 22 metres in diameter. Eight of the stones are of spotted dolerite, the famous ï¿½bluestoneï¿½ sourced as being from the Carn Meini outcrops to the north (Burl mentions only one). Recent geophysical survey by the SPACES project, searching for any buried structures which might lie hidden beneath the circle, revealed nothing. The conclusion is that this monument probably looks much the same today as it did to its late Neolithic or Bronze Age builders. Nearby is a pair of standing stones (NPRN 304281) which appears to frame the distant Carn Menyn outcrop when viewed from the south-west. In his 1963 Shell Guide, Vyvyan Rees was unimpressed; ï¿½Gors Fawr, the only recognisable stone circle left in the county, is very smallï¿½. It is, in fact, a remarkable survivor and one of the best of its kind to be seen in Wales'.(1) Although the stones that form the circle are comparatively small (1 - 1.5m tall), they are graded in height as noted by Burl (A. Burl,The Stone Circles of the British Isles, Yale U.P., 1976) and other archaeologists. The tallest surviving stones form the south-eastern quadrant of the circle, with the lowest to the west-southwest. The two large outlying pillar stones 134 m to the north-northeast of the stone circle are positioned 13.7 m apart. They could be viewed as an alignment or as a ï¿½portalï¿½ with the stones acting like gateposts framing a view between them. As an alignment, the two standing stones form a southwest-northeast orientation, and this points in the north-easterly direction to the position of the midsummer sunrise alignment over the nearby hill of Foel Drych (A.Thom,Megalithic Sites in Britain, Oxford U.P., 1967), now unfortunately obscured by local tree cover. 'The magnetic stone has a curious shape     that allows it to form a seat; using this to sit on the stone,     one's head leans back on precisely that part of the outlier     which most affects a compass. It is not beyond the bounds of     possibility that if one is in a certain mental state, engendered     by fasting, dancing or hallucinogens, the placing of the     head in the stone's magnetic field may trigger or enhance     visionary or spiritual experiences, the hippocampus being subtly     massaged by the magnetism'. This parcel of land is/was the recipient of streams coming off Mynydd Preseli, on which Carn Menyn is situated, so there is a physical as well as visual link between the two areas. There may also have been a ceremonial, symbolic link, and the route of the bluestones off Preseli at the beginning of their journey to Stonehenge may have passed by Gors Fawr, according to the Pilot Studyï¿½s consultant, Professor Timothy Darvill. It has been suggested that certain stones from  places that were 'venerated' were circulated over considerable distances in the Neolithic era of prehistory. These ï¿½pieces of placesï¿½ are considered as relics 'charged with the sanctity, themana, of their homeland, much as the bones of saints that were circulated and venerated in Medieval times were thought to possess magical and healing qualities'. So what besides their colour made these bluestones so special? 'There is an intriguing aspect   to the Preseli bluestones ï¿½ a relatively high proportion of them   (perhaps as much as ten percent) have the usually rare property of   being ï¿½musicalï¿½. That is, they can ring like a bell or gong, or   resound like a drum, when struck with a small hammer-stone,   instead of the dull clunking sound rock-on-rock usually makes.   That this property has been noted locally down the generations is   shown by the ï¿½Maenclochogï¿½ (ï¿½Ringing stonesï¿½) village place-name   in the Preseli area'.

This phenomenon of a possible 'primal   mound' visible on the extreme horizon to the north of a stone circleï¿½s position recurs time and again throughout the British Isles so the monument was probably not randomly located. The theme of the   'Primal mound' (with an associated prominent stone-circle) is   repeated at several of the most significant Neolithic sites in   Europe, in which the monuments form part of larger 'ceremonial   landscapes', which appear to have been selected and built into in   such a way so as to 'unite' people, stones, landscape features and   even the heavens.

"Goseck, Germany",Oldest Solar Observatory,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/germanygoseck.htm,"Goseck, Germany","The Goseck Henge is an early Neolithic Henge-structure with entrances orientated to the rising and setting winter solstice sun. At c. 5,000 BC, the Goseck 'Henge' is considered the earliest solar observatory currently known in the world.(2). It lies on the same latitude as Stonehenge. (51ï¿½ 10' 42"" N, 1ï¿½ 49.4' W), at just over 1' minute of longitude further north (approx 1000m ). The Stonehenge 'Post-holes' are dated at least a thousand years earlier than this monument, but the Henge is considerably older than the one in England. When archaeologists Peter Biehl and Francois Bertemes decided to excavate a 7,000-year-old circular enclosure outside of Goseck, Germany, in 2002, they didn't expect to make any major discoveries, certainly nothing that might rewrite the history of Neolithic Europe. ""We had just started our archaeology program, and we wanted a place near the university for our students to practice,"" says Biehl, formerly a professor at Halle-Wittenberg University and now at Cambridge. Combining Global Positioning System data with archaeological evidence from the site, they realised that the two southern gates of the Henge marked the start of the summer and winter solstice, making the enclosure possibly the world's oldest solar observatory. The farmers of Neolithic Central Europe, who most scholars believed were a generally unsophisticated group who tilled the land with basic wooden tools, were actually measuring the heavens far earlier than anyone had ever believed.(1) The Goseck enclosure and hundreds of similar wooden circular Henges were built throughout Austria, Germany, and the Czech Republic during a 200-year period around 4,600 BC. While the sites vary in size--the one at Goseck is around 220 feet in diameter--they all have the same features. A narrow ditch surrounds a circular wooden wall, with a few large gates equally spaced around the outer edge. While scholars have known about the enclosures for nearly a century, they were stumped as to their exact function within the Stroke-Ornamented Pottery culture (known by its German acronym, STK) that dominated Central Europe at the time.(1) The circle at Goseck is one of more than 250 ring-ditches in Germany, Austria and Croatia identified by aerial surveys, though archaeologists have investigated barely 10% of them. Goloring near Koblenz in western Germany is a similar, if later, example. Previously archaeologists thought that the enclosures might have been fortifications and were puzzled by the fact that there was no sign of buildings inside the circles. Archaeologists know nothing of the appearance or language of the people and can only surmise about their religious beliefs. The culture is known only as that of stroke-ornamented ceramic ware, from fragments of pottery it left. The jars and bowls had their decoration jabbed into the soft clay with a kind of fork to form zig-zag lines. The whole period of stroke-ornamented pottery is limited to 4,900 to 4,650 BC.(5)  The Goseck Henge is currently the oldest official 'Solar observatory' in the world. On the winter solstice, the sun could be seen to rise and set through the Southern gates from the centre. It has been observed that the entrances get progressively smaller the closer to the centre one gets, which would have concentrated the suns rays into a narrow path. Being on the same latitude as Stonehenge means that 'astronomers' would have also benefitted from viewed the extremes of the sun and moon at right angles to each other. It is also sitting on one of two unique latitudesin the world at which the full moon passes directly overhead on its maximum Zeniths. The two opposing arcs, which run along the rim of the Nebra Sky Disc, are 82.5 degrees long and mark the sun's positions at sunrise and sunset. The lowest points of the two arcs are 97.5 degrees apart, signifying sunrise and sunset on the winter solstice in central Germany at the time. Likewise, the uppermost points mark sunrise and sunset on the summer solstice. The sun's position at solstice has shifted slightly over the past millennia, notes Wolfhard Schlosser of the Ruhr University in Bochum, so that the angle between sunrise and sunset is now slightly farther apart than when the Nebra disk and the Goseck circle were made (by 1.6 and 2.8 degrees, respectively).(4) The 3,600-year-old bronze Nebra disc was discovered just 25 kilometres away from Goseck in the wooded region of Nebra and is considered to be the oldest concrete representation of the cosmos. The 32-centimeter disc is decorated with gold leaf symbols that clearly represent the sun, moon and starts. A cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the Pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago, almost 2,000 years after the Goseck Circle.

When archaeologists Peter Biehl and Francois Bertemes decided to excavate a 7,000-year-old circular enclosure outside of Goseck, Germany, in 2002, they didn't expect to make any major discoveries, certainly nothing that might rewrite the history of Neolithic Europe.
Combining Global Positioning System data with archaeological evidence from the site, they realised that the two southern gates of the Henge marked the start of the summer and winter solstice, making the enclosure possibly the world's oldest solar observatory.
The farmers of Neolithic Central Europe, who most scholars believed were a generally unsophisticated group who tilled the land with basic wooden tools, were actually measuring the heavens far earlier than anyone had ever believed.(1) The Goseck enclosure and hundreds of similar wooden circular Henges were built throughout Austria, Germany, and the Czech Republic during a 200-year period around 4,600 BC.

"Grande Menhir Brisé, France",Largest Menhir in Europe,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/francelegrandmenhir.htm,"Le Grande Menhir Brise, France","This stone has the honour of having once been the largest (known) standing stone in Europe and the largest of a huge 19-stone alignment. Today the menhir is broken into four pieces which still lie where they fell. Le Grandmenhir lies alongsideLa Table des Marchandspassage-mound, andtheEr-Grahtumulus, both built at around 3,300 BC, following the destruction of the original alignment, which is now suspected of having been broken up and distributed around the Morbihan area (see below). Le Grand Menhir is one of three structures at the Locmariaquer site. It lies beside theEr-Grah tumulusand theTable des Marchands, both built around 3,300 BC. It is also the last surviving stone of an earlier construction dating from around 4,500 BC(6).The original structure is thought to have been broken around 4000 BC.  The stone, now fallen into 4 pieces, is estimated to have weighed about 355 tons when complete and to have stood over 20 metres high(1). It was hand 'mauled' into its present shape and an axe-plough figure was once visible on the middle fragment. John Michell reports the nearest source of similar stone at over 50 miles distance(4), and even though newer reports suggest a distance of only 10km north of Auray(5), it still highlights the fact that the location outweighed the difficulties involved in transporting such large stones over long distances. John Michell records an Admiralty report of 1659, on a local shipwreck, which noted that: A Picture by Robien from 1725 shows the stone fallen, which places the time of the fall between 1659 and 1725. The site was suggested by Prof. A. Thom to have served as a lunar marker, from which it would have been able to calculate the 18.6yr lunar cycle by observing the stone from positions in the surrounding countryside. He predicted the locations of the sites and found ancient markers at several of them, confirming his hypothesis.   In 1984, archaeologists uncovered the hidden upper-side of theGavr'iniscapstone and found that it bore engravings that fitted with those at La Table des Marchands, along with another stone on top of the 'Er Vingle' or 'Er Grah' tumulus. It was concluded that the three slabs once formed a single menhir 15m tall, which if we add another 2-3m for the missing section, results in a stone that measures 17-18m, (which would leave approximately an estimated 15m remaining visible above ground level). In order to estimate the expected heights of the other stones, we need the height of the last stone, which we can guess at being slightly over the height of an average observer (we can suggest a height of approximately 2m). If the tallest stood at 16m, the shortest at 2m, and with 17 others in-between, We can now estimate the difference in height between each of the other stones. (14m / 17 = 82.353cm), a figure that is coincidentally almost exactly onemegalithic yardlong (82.966cm). Although the rest of the menhirs appear to have been taken and re-used over time, parts of one remain at the site, having been re-used for the capstones of the neighbouringLa Table des MarchandsandEr-Grahmonuments. The Table des Marchands cap-stone has several distinct carvings on it and the discovery in 1984 of matching carvings on the cap-stone of theGavrinismound confirmed that the three stones fitted together until they were re-used sometime around 3,300 BC.    It is interesting to note that there are 19 crescent symbols on the top edges of the end-stone inside the Table des Marchands (see left side of photo-right). This number has been suggested as being related to the lunar cycle which lasts 18.6 solar years, supporting the idea that the original site functioned as a means of measuring and calculating the lunar cycles.

"La Marche, France",Palaeolithic Caves,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/francelamarche.htm,"La Marche, France","The cave located at La Marche in France was discovered in 1937 by Leon Pericard, a French amateur scientist, and Sthane Lwoff, a palaeontologist. They spent five years excavating the cave and found more than 1,500 pieces of slate with painted carvings on them. These images are very difficult to understand. Sometimes, several objects in the drawings would overlap each other. Nevertheless, in the eyes of archaeologists, these drawings carry special meaning. In the La Marche cave, you can find paintings of lions, bears, antelope, horses, and 155 vivid human portraits dating from around 15,000 BP, a time long before the rise of the great civilisations and a time when Europe was firmly in the grip of an Ice Age.  When French scientist Lï¿½on Pï¿½ricard excavated La Marche between 1937 and 1942 he catalogued over 1,500 slabs of limestone that had been carefully placed on the floor(1).In addition, many of the engravings show people wearing hats, robes and boots. Although this does not coincide with the previously accepted view of prehistoric people, it may be because paintings depicting clothed humans were destroyed in the other caves while scientists were studying the walls (In Lascaux, for example, the floor was obliterated to make way for visitors in the 1950s. There is no way of knowing if anything significant was destroyed). Pï¿½ricard originally found 69 human figurines in the caves. There were 49 etchings of heads alone and 18 with the whole body. All together, there were 50 etchings of females, 12 of males and 5 that were of indeterminate gender. Eventually, 155 human figurines were found.(8) Certain findings at La Marche have led to greater debate over the origin and development of writing systems. In particular, an engraved reindeer antler from La Marche has provided proof that more sophisticated systems of symbols existed during the Paleolithic period than once believed. Francesco dï¿½Errico, an archaeologist who analyzed the antler, sees it as proof that humans at this time had ï¿½artificial memory systems,ï¿½ which enabled them to record various groupings of information(9)  Additionally, Dr. Michael Rappenglueck has noted pits arranged like certain constellations on the cave floor. One constellation on La Marcheï¿½s floor, the Pleiades, has been found engraved on the walls of Neolithic caves, but rarely on those of the Palaeolithic. Dr. Rappenglueck has suggested that these pits might have been filled with animal fat and set on fire to replicate the stars in the sky. If so, Rappenglueck ventures, this site could mark the origin of the candlelit festivals in the Far East that also celebrate the Pleiades.

"Lascaux, France",Palaeolithic Caves,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/francelascaux.htm,"Lascaux, France","Lascaux contains some of the best-known Upper Palaeolithic art. These paintings are estimated to be around 17,300 years old.(1)They primarily consist of primitive images of large animals, most of which are now known from fossil evidence to have lived in the area at the time. Lascaux is one of the worlds richest examples of cave-art with over 1,500 engravings and 600 drawings having been documented. The Vï¿½zï¿½re valley in which Lascaux is found contains 147 prehistoric sites dating from the Palaeolithic and 25 decorated caves.(1)  In addition to the painted images, Lascaux is rich with engravings of animals as well as abstract designs. It has long been argued that in the absence of natural light, these works could only have been created with the aid of torches and stone lamps filled with animal fat, however new research has suggested that the parts of the caves might have been temporarily illuminated by the sun at certain times of the year (see below). There are various theories on the significance of the paintings: Some people believe them to be records of real life events, others an astro-mythical representation of the night skies, and there are those that believe them to be 'Shamanic offerings' or 'Hunt Magic'(6). Perhaps a little of each may be true. Today, we are left to marvel at their skilful execution and artistic beauty It has been suggested that the art represents moments from real life such as hunts which were drawn on the wall like a comic strip. (The story of the hunt goes from the left to the right, until the prey is captured). We can assume from their large number that the society from which the artist(s) came from tolerated people painting walls while others hunted or made weapons for the hunters. At Lascaux andChauvet, another magnificently painted cave in France, images of animals are superimposed on top of earlier depictions, which suggests that the motivation for the paintings may have been in the act of portraying the animals rather than in the artistic effect of the final composition. However, their purpose remains obscure. Most of the paintings are located at a distance from the cave's entrance, and many of the chambers are not easily accessible. This placement, together with the enormous size and compelling grandeur of the paintings, suggests that the remote chambers may have served as sacred or ceremonial meeting places. In recent years, new research has suggested that the Lascaux paintings may incorporate prehistoric star charts. Dr Michael Rappenglueck of the University of Munich argued that some of the non-figurative dot clusters and dots within some of the figurative images correlate with the constellations of Taurus, The Pleiades and the grouping known as the ""Summer Triangle"".(2)Based on her own study of the astronomical significance of Bronze Age petroglyphs in the Vallï¿½e des Merveilles and her extensive survey of other prehistoric cave painting sites in the region ï¿½ most of which appear to have been specifically selected because the interiors are illuminated by the setting sun on the day of the winter solstice ï¿½ French researcher Chantal Jï¿½gues-Wolkiewiez has further proposed that the gallery of figurative images in the Great Hall represents an extensive star map and that key points on major figures in the group correspond to stars in the main constellations as they appeared in the Palaeolithic.(3) Near to the entrance of the Lascaux cave complex is a magnificent painting of a bull. Hanging over its shoulder is what appears (to us) to be a map of the Pleiades, the cluster of stars sometimes called the Seven Sisters. Inside the bull painting, there are also indications of spots that may be a representation of other stars found in that region of sky. Today, this region forms part of the constellation of Taurus the bull, with the remarkable suggestion of a direct transfer of information for over 17,000 years. ï¿½At Lascaux in 15,300 B.C. the Pleiades were very near the point of the autumn equinox (: 12h, : 0ï¿½), when we consider the relation to the position of thebrighteststar25 ï¿½ Tau (Alcyone; 2m.9, : 12h 16.6m, : +2ï¿½ 51ï¿½). That means that the distance separating the two was the equivalent of only 5.5 times the width of the moon, that is only 2.8ï¿½ away from the equinoctial point. Even better is the star 27 ï¿½ Tau (Atlas; 3m.6, : 12h 17.8m, : +2ï¿½ 34ï¿½). This star reached its smallest distance of 2.6ï¿½ at the time of 15300BC. Only [one] hundred years earlier or later the distance was already larger.ï¿½ ï¿½The six stars in the Salle des Taureaux therefore represent a striking and excellent heavenly marker for the beginning of autumn and of spring. The epoch calculated astronomically lies extraordinarily close to the uncalibrated oldest carbon fourteen dating: 17,190 ï¿½ 140 radiocarbon years (with the reference point being 1950) and 17300 astronomical years (in reference to the year 2000), corresponding to 15,300 BC. The difference is minimal even if the margin of error of the astronomical calculation is taken as being ï¿½ 500 years.ï¿½(7) The plan and section of the entrance to the cave show that before the landslide had blocked the entrance, at sunset on the summer solstice, the sun illuminated the inside of the cave. In 1999, the curator of Lascaux and others witnessed the event for the first time in over 15,000 years. The sunlight entered the cave for approximately 50 minutes and was bright enough to work by for almost an hour for a few days of the year. They also calculated that the light of the full-moon would enter the cave directly on the morning of the winter solstice.(8) The carbon dioxide produced by the breathing of thousands of visitors (up to 1800 per day at one time)(4), the presence of lighting and changes in air circulation have created a number of problems inside Lascaux. In the late 1950s appearance of lichens and crystals on the walls led to closure of the caves in 1963. This led to restriction of access to the real caves to a few vistors every week and the creation of a replica cave for visitors to Lascaux. In 2001, the authorities in charge of Lascaux changed the air conditioning system which resulted in regulation of the temperature and humidity. When the system had been established, an infestation ofFusarium solani, a white mould, began spreading rapidly across the cave ceiling and walls.(4)The mould is considered to have been present in the cave soil and exposed by the working of tradesmen, leading to the spread of the fungus which was treated with quicklime. Since 2007, a new fungus, which has created grey and black blemishes, has begun spreading in the real cave. After World War II, the small cave was opened to the public and, at one point, it was receiving as many as 1,800 visitors per day. But by the late 1950s, the visitorsï¿½ breath was blamed for the appearance of lichen and small crystals on the walls, prompting the government to close Lascaux to the public in 1963. Since then, only five people per day, five days a week, have been allowed to visit the underground gallery by special permission, and tourists are steered into a replica of the cave complex nearby. The replica, known as Lascaux II, opened in 1983 and now draws more than 250,000 tourists each year. 'Recent research on Lascaux has included some investigations of the hundreds of bacteria which have formed in the cave. Because it was air conditioned for decades, and then treated biochemically to reduce mould, many pathogens have made a home in the cave, including the bacillus for Legionnaire's disease. It is unlikely that the cave will ever be opened to the public again...'. At least 20 caves in France and Spain show evidence of 'mutilated' hands. In Lascaux, accidental prints of mutilated hands left in clay and now hardened by calcite have been discovered, proving that their hands were indeed mutilated (although the cause is unknown). The Grotte de Gargas in France where 231 outlines off hands were found on the walls, of which over half were mutilated. It is tentatively suggested that because of the remaining thumbs on all the hands, frostbite might be involved.(5)    ","(45.053919, 1.167651)",45.053919,1.167651,"These paintings are estimated to be around 17,300 years old.(1)They primarily consist of primitive images of large animals, most of which are now known from fossil evidence to have lived in the area at the time.

"La Venta, Mexico",Olmec Capital,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicolaventa.htm,"La Venta, Mexico","La Venta was inhabited by people of the Olmec Culture from 1200 BC until 400 BC after which the site appears to have been abandoned. It is believed to have been an important civic and ceremonial centre. Today, the entire southern end of the site is covered by a petroleum refinery and has been largely demolished, making further excavations difficult or impossible.  Beneath the mounds and plazas were found a vast array of offerings and other buried objects, more than 50 separate caches by one count, including buried Jade celts, polished mirrors made of iron-ores, and five large ""Massive Offerings"" of Serpentine blocks. It is estimated that 'Massive Offering 3' contains 50 tons of carefully finished serpentine blocks, covered by 4,000 tons of clay fill.  The Great Pyramid: One of the earliest pyramids known in Mesoamerica, the Great Pyramid is 110 ft (33 m) high and contains an estimated 100,000 cubic meters of earth fill. The current conical shape of the pyramid was once thought to represent nearby volcanoes or mountains, but recent work by Rebecca Gonzalez-Lauck has shown that the pyramid was originally a rectangular pyramid with stepped sides and inset corners, and the current shape is most likely due to 2500 years of erosion. The pyramid itself has never been excavated, but a magnetometer survey in 1967 found an anomaly high on the south side of the pyramid. Speculation ranges from a section of burned clay to a cache of buried offerings to a tomb. Four heads were found at La Venta, all of them faced the Atlantic, and the largest at 9ft high had its domed top flattened so that it could function as an altar.The La Venta heads show several similarities to the Tres Zapotes heads, which were discovered before them. It emerged that they dominated the ceremonial plaza, a feature which suggests that they were in some way 'revered'.A speaking tube was found going in at the ear and out at the mouth; a possibleoracleor talking god. Radio carbon dates from the site were published in 1957 and they give an average reading of 814 BC +/- 134 yrs.  These figures were among the oldest at the La Venta site. The La Venta heads are thought to have been carved by 700 BCE, but possibly as early as 850 BCE, while the San Lorenzo heads are credited to an earlier period. The colossal heads can measure up to 9 ft 4 in. in height and weigh several tons. The sheer size of the stones causes a great deal of speculation on how the Olmecs were able to move them. The major basalt quarry for the colossal heads at La Venta was found at Cerro Cintepec in the Tuxtla Mountains, over 80 km away.(1) This Guatemalan Stone-head was     once a part of the great Monte Alto culture, which is believed     by some to have preceded the Olmec culture. It was unfortunately     destroyed in the process of removing it. The Monte Alto region     has also produced several stone heads, many of which have been     found to be naturally magnetic. Of the     collection of ""fat boy"" sculptures from Monte Alto on display in     the town park of La Democracia, Guatemala and in front of its     local museum, four of the heads and three of the bodies were     found to have magnetic properties. All four of the heads have a     north magnetic pole located in their right temples, while three     of them have south magnetic poles below the right ear and the     fourth (that in front of the museum) has a south magnetic pole     in its left temple, Such a pattern of occurrence is unlikely to     be a matter of chance, even in a sample size as small as four.(5) What appears to be a ceremony was modelled and buried below the surface of a temple courtyard at some 3,000 years ago. Some unknown time after the initial burial, the site was opened again through the courtyard floor (clearly, someone knew exactly where the burial was located) and excavated to the level of the heads of the buried figurines. After this ""inspection"", the offering was covered up again and never opened again until recent time. Note the elongated skulls, a feature which became common in several pre-Columbian cultures, noticeably in the Paracas, Maya and Inca's. This beautifully carved stone shows what appears to be a person sitting on a feathered serpent. The ceremonial nature of the site makes it likely that this representation held an importance to the Olmecs, presumably symbolising an event or a person. It is interesting to note that there have been suggestions that La Venta was inhabited by people with old-world connections such as representations of bearded people (which is a genetic trail absent from native Americans), the large life-like stone heads with clearly Negriod features (above), but it is interesting to note also the object being held out by the hand... In consideration the of the theory forwarded by Van Sertima(3)and others, that the 'Olmec'   site of La Venta was governed by Negroid Africans and Middle-eastern   Caucasians (between 800-600 BC), there is a strong case for the re-appraise the symbolism   behind this particular sculpture.

It is interesting to note that there have been suggestions that La Venta was inhabited by people with old-world connections such as representations of bearded people (which is a genetic trail absent from native Americans), the large life-like stone heads with clearly Negriod features (above), but it is interesting to note also the object being held out by the hand...",Mexico,North America
"Lios na Grainsi, Ireland",Stone Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/irelandliosnagrainsi.htm,"Lios Na Grainsi, Ireland","Grange is Ireland's largest stone circle, consisting of 113 stones. Built ca. 2100 B.C., it is over 150 feet in diameter. Its nearly perfect shape is suggestive of it having been drawn out with a string-line from the centre. It is surrounded by an earthen bank, which in places is three to four feet high and gives it the vague appearance of ahengemonument. A'LIOS'orGrangeis the name given in Ireland to a ring-fort or stone circle. The word ""Grange"" is an English rendering of the Irish word ""Grian"", which means ""Sun"". This lends credence to the theory that stone circles in Ireland were connected with sun worship, as at the larger stone circles of New-Grangeand Stonehenge in England. The entrance on the eastern side is paved and flanked by uprights. Clay has been packed down to a depth of 60 cm across the whole area of the enclosure. On excavation it was found to be littered with late Neolithic Beaker pottery, which seemed to have been deliberately smashed.(1)Its near perfect shape and the discovery of a posthole in the very centre of the enclosure, indicates that the circle was measured out from a central stake with a rope.

"Loire Valley, France",Large Dolmens,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/franceloire.htm,"The Loire Dolmens, France","This group of dolmens  is congregated between Samur to Blois, on the river Loire are some of the most impressive in France. They are puzzling to archaeologists as none of them appear to have ever been covered with earth, and there have been no human remains found in them, which precludes them from having been intended for passage mounds or funerary structures.(1) The Loire dolmens were constructed with huge granite slabs, often seen with squared-off edges and corners, the largest chamber at Bagneux is so big that one has the feeling that one might be entering a temple or meeting chamber. The   largest 'dolmen' in France- It has has four massive capstoneseach about 2ft thick with the largest estimated 'very accurately by Vice-Admiral Boyle Summerville to weigh just over 86 tons'.  A   plaque at the site tells us that the overall length of the dolmen is   23m (75ft), with the internal chamber at over 18m (60ft) in length and   at least 3m high.   There are no carvings or markings present. This site is unlike any   other (remaining) and the specific design suggests a function. As   with the other Saumur dolmens, it was built with large stone slabs,   squared and trimmed in a style particular to this area. This spectacular 'dolmen' is one of the largest in all Europe. Although the capstoneis now broken into four pieces, it is estimated to have originally weighed in at around 100 tons. This is strictly not a dolmen, but rather a 'portalled chamber', with a distinct portalled entrance and several internal supporting stones (under the cracks in the capstone), which now divide the chamber into smaller sections. It opens to the south-east, suggesting a possible orientation towards the winter solstice sunrise. Location: On the D69 just south-east of Gennes, Nr Saumur. This 'Dolmen' is   located on a hill with a good view of the surrounding countryside.   It is approximately 10m long, 4m wide and around 3.5m high.    The structure, when compared with other giant local dolmen, has   less squared stones, and a more 'natural' feel to the shape of the   stones and the way they were put together, suggesting an earlier   construction. The Dolmen de la Madelaine has a   (Possibly incidental) side entrance at one end and is open-ended at the other. This   design is unlike any other of the Saumur 'dolmens', although the   three cap-stones and overall style, size and 'square-ness' are.  Location: East ofBaugeand   accessible along a track through woodland. It is constructed in   the same style as the other dolmens of the region, with a portalled entrance and a huge cap-stone which is now broken in   two. Thesmallestdolmen in France?- There are several other   dolmens along this stretch of the Loire, mostly built to the same   scale as those above, but it is ironic that in this very same area   of such giant structures, that the smallest dolmen (That I've   seen) in France can also be found. This dolmen lies   east ofLandes de Gaulois,nearBlois. It stands   under 1m high, and is just over a metre in width and depth. The   similarity in design to its giant neighbours (such as thesixcompletely unnecessary supporting stones), gives it the appearance   of a 'dwarf' dolmen, or possibly a scale model, anyway the stark   contrast with other structures in the area results in a guaranteed   chuckle  for any intrepid hunter.  Not   far from this miniature dolmen, isLa Pierre Levee, (or'La Table-du-Diablo' - The Devil's table), which is   constructed in the same style as, but nowhere nearly as grand as   its giant Loire neighbours. It has good visibility, and was made   from noticeably different rock to the ones near Saumur and Tours.   It is dated at around 3,500BC. This dolmen lies   on the D957, just north of Blois. The information plaque at the   site identifies another ten dolmens and menhirs in the immediate   vicinity. As with other dolmens in the area, it has a portal   entrance and it is orientated east/west with its entrance facing   the sunrise at the equinoxes.   'Bouche Dolmen'- This dolmen is located in a farmers field nearBouche. It is   partially collapsed, and has the appearance of having had one or   two of the support stones pulled out from under one side. Before   its collapse, it would have had a portalled entrance, and is   similar in size toLa Pierre couvert(above). The capstone   is split in half as atLa Pierre couvert, but with squared-off ends.  Other dolmens can also be found north of the Loire at Soucelles, La Roche Thibault, Bauge, Nr Mettray (La Grotte des Fees). South of the river in the Samur region there are more west of Gennes and in a farmyard near St. Hilaire (Dolmen de la Pierre Boire), and the massiveLe Gros-Chillouat Briancon, Cravant, which is 50 ft (15.2 metres) long and 10 ft (3.1 metres) high.

"Longyou, China",Carved Caves,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/chinalongyou.htm,"Longyou Caves, China","Although the overall excavation involved almost a million cubic metres of stone, there is no historical record of them or evidence of the work. Their origin is a complete mystery. In June, 1992, a villager named Wu Anai, decided to pump the water out in one of the locally known caves revealing the first of many man-made caves in the region.  After 17 days pumping, enough water had been removed to reveal the cave including several carved stelae, thus confirming his idea that they were not natural reservoirs at all, but rather man-made. The floor of the grotto occupies more than 2,000 square meters, with the tallest point of the cave exceeding 30 meters. The four steles of cave 1 are symmetrically distributed. Following this discovery, he continued to pump out another four caves only to find that they all bore the same markings on the walls and ceilings. A rough estimation of the workload involved in building these five caves is awe-inspiring. The four caves cover an average floor surface of 1,200 square meters, so each of the caves should have involved excavation of 36,000 cubic meters of stone. Since a total of at least 24 such caves have already been found in Shiyanbei Village, the overall excavation would be 900,000 cubic meters.(1)  The chiselling on the cave walls and ceilings was executed in such a way that it has left them covered in a uniform pattern which some people believe is symbolic. It is similar to pottery found in the nearby museum which is dated between 500 and 800 BC.  In Cave 1, which has been opened for tourism, stone carvings executed in a craftsmanship of ancient simplicity, of horse, fish and bird, may be seen (Land, Water and Air). The bird head has an appearance similar to one unearthed at the Hemudu site.(2) Like most villages in southern China, there are numerous ponds in Shiyanbei, but these are mostly rectangular, and very deep, having been known as ""bottomless ponds"" by generations of villagers. These ponds teem with fish, which are easily caught. After the first cave was pumped dry not a single fish was to be seen.(2) This discovery has called the attention of many specialists from China, Japan, Poland, Singapore and USA. One of the most interesting and challenging questions is how the caverns have been able to keep their integrity for more than 2000 years.(3)  ","(29.0282699, 119.17225)",29.0282699,119.17225,"In June, 1992, a villager named Wu Anai, decided to pump the water out in one of the locally known caves revealing the first of many man-made caves in the region.

Scattered over these peaks and the slopes of Loughcrew are 30 megalithic cairns in various states of decay. Loughcrew; from 'Loch Craobh', (The Lake of Branches), is a collection of passage mounds spread across four adjoining hill-tops. Unfortunately, it seems as though much of the site was lost, as there were probably once as many as 50 passage mounds on the site(1). The site is well worth visiting as if not just for the views. Although the main mound is closed, there are still plenty of open mounds to explore, with engravings of spirals etc on nearly every one. Cairbane West:Fifteen remaining monuments. Cairn   L, An unusual chambered cairn, with seven recesses, three on each   side and one at the end. The   right-back recess, as is usual with these monuments, is much larger   than the others. It contains a massive stone basin and one of the   finest engravings at Loughcrew (pictures below). The monument was   reconstructed in the 1940's by the Office of Public Works When   Conwell arrived in 1863 the roof had collapsed and the chamber was   full of rubble. He estimated that the capstone probably stood between   16' and 18' above the floor of the chamber.

"Los Millares, Spain",Prehistoric Citadel,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/spainlosmillares.htm,"Los Millares, Spain","The site includes a settlement and a cemetery with over 80 megalithic tombs. Three walls and an inner citadel with an elaborate fortified entrance make up part of extensive fortifications at Los Millares. Thirteen nearly circular enclosures were forts protecting it. Within the three walls are 80 passage graves.   Los Millares was constructed in three phases, each phase increasing the level of fortification. The fortification is not unique to the Mediterranean area of the 3rd millennium; other sites with bastions and defensive towers include the sites of Jericho, Ai, and Aral (in Palestine) and Lebous, Boussargues and Campe of Laures (in France). It consists of a settlement, guarded by numerous outlying forts and a cemetery ofpassage tombs and covers around 5 acres. The settlement itself was surrounded by three concentric walls with fourbastions;radiocarbon dating has established that one wall collapsed and was rebuilt around 3,025 BC. A cluster of simple dwellings lay inside the walls as well as one large building containing evidence ofcopper smelting. Finally, the fortified citadel at the very top of the spur has only been investigated so far by means of various pilot trenches, which have revealed walls up to six metres thick, confirming the great importance of the structure. Within its grounds there is a deep hollow, which Siret concluded must be a water cistern but so far has not been excavated. The strategic sequence of the site shows that the settlement went through various phases of occupation. The first was during the early copper age (3,200 to 2,800 B.C.) when the three interior walls were constructed. The second was during the middle copper age (2,800 to 2,450 B.C.), when the innermost wall was demolished and the outer wall constructed, together with most of the small forts outside the settlement itself. Finally, in the late copper age (2,450 to 2,250 B.C.) the first bell beakers appeared, a form of pottery that was produced henceforth on a large scale in the village. During this late period some profound social upheaval brought about a gradual decline in the size of the settlement, whose inhabitants gradually retired towards the fortified citadel. The site appears to have been finally abandoned around 2,250 B.C Over eighty megalithic tombs are visible outside the settlement. The majority are of the type mentioned above, but tombs without corbelled roofs also exist. The chronology of tomb construction and use is unclear, but analysis of tomb forms, sizes, numbers of burials, contents, and distributions suggests that the dead were selected for interment and that social ranking had emerged, with higher-ranked groups being buried in tombs located close to the settlement. SimilarTholosTombs are common in Mycanaean remains, and a connection is commonly suggested. They are also present at other places in Spain, noticeably at theCueva de Viera, which sits beside the great Cueva de Menga passage mound. Holed stones are also a common feature of dolmens in the Caucasus region of Russia where hundreds are visible. The entrances were divided by large sheets of slate which were punched through and rounded off to make the entrances we see today. The chambers of theTholoswere lined with vertical slabs of slate, often painted red, sometimes with small niches present (used for the burial of children). The graves were finally covered over with conical mounds of earth and stones. Many were given an outer skirting of slabs or masonry to strengthen the structure. Almost all the tombs were orientated east of southeast, except for a small group of seven mounds were orientated southwest. The tombs were collective with the number of skeletons discovered ranging from a dozen to over a hundred. Burial offerings included objects such as ivory and ostrich eggshell, copper tools, pottery vessels, arrowheads and flint knives.(1) The presence of such great quantities of mineral resources in the region is likely to be part of the reason for the existence of Los Millares in the first place. The parallels with theMinoanscontinues in the addition of arsenic as an antioxidant to their copper products. Arsenic is readily available in the local region of Sierra de Gador. Among the buildings dedicated to specialised activities, two areas have been identified as having once housed metallurgical workshops. While along the northern stretch of the outer wall there are several square and round buildings dedicated to this, the best preserved worksghop is situated in a large rexctangular building attached to the inner facade of the third line of fortification. Of considerable size, about 8m long by 6.5m wide, it was built with a solid masonry technique, with a door opening to the east. Inside are the ermains of three structures: a mass of 1.3m in diameter with fragments of copper ore, a furnace deliniated by a ring of clay with a depression at its centre to put the pot furnaces, and a small structure with slabs of slate in its northeast corner.

The structures are built from white granite, with blocks reaching up to 3.7 metres in length. There are nearly 200 rooms at Machu Picchu, including residences, temples,   storage buildings, altars, and observatories. There were also several   shrines for the practice of ancestor worship of the Inca, a religious cult in which centuries-old mummies of ancestors were kept   and tended. Doorways and walls were not necessarily rectangular in outline   or plan, but all fit together tightly. Evidence of several fires have been   discovered at Machu Picchu,   particularly in the area known as the Torreon, which was thought to have   held the mummy of Pachacuti himself. The fires were likely the work of the   Spanish, who attempted to obliterate the old Incan religion.

Malta,Megalithic Island Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/malta.htm,Prehistoric malta,"Malta has been host to several ancient cultures and is The Hypogeum(of Hal-Saflieni)- Probably the most well known megalithic site on Malta is theHypogeum,a carved-out underground complex from which the remains of 7,000 human skeletons were found (although only a hand-full now remain). The Hypogeum offers a unique insight into the mind of the Maltese temple builders, and the discovery of a second Hypogeum on Gozo (Hypogeum II), reinforces the image of a people preoccupied with the rituals of life and death. Mnajdra and Hagar Qim- These two  temple complexes were constructed in close proximity of each. They are a good example of the 'paired-temple' theory which is prevalent across Malta. The temples at both sites are filled with 'Holed Stones' and 'Mushroom' altars, suggesting a 'ceremonial' function. They are shaped as most Maltese temples in the shape of the Earth-mother, and were built with their entrances facing towards the sea and winter solstice sun.  Ggantija and the Xaghrastone-circle- These two sites are the most prominent on the island of Gozo, and their close proximity to each other classifies them as another example of 'paired sites'. Of extreme interest is the fact that within and under the Xaghra circle, a second hypogeum was discovered (The Hypogeum II), from which the remains of approximately 700 human skeletons was recovered. The obvious similarity to Hal Tarxien and the Hypogeum on Malta has led some to consider the idea that other hypogea may be one day found on Malta. There are several excellent examples of 'Cart-ruts' on Malta (and Gozo), and in the waters surrounding the islands too. For a long time now these rock-carved features have been judged on their appearance only, and they certainly appear superficially to have been the result of multitudes of passing vehicles. In 2005, the European commission sponsored an international research program to identify the true nature of these ruts, which have now been found in several other countries, but nowhere more prolific than in Malta. It was once claimed of Malta that (with the exception ofMnajdra), 'There are no significant astronomical alignments, they are all inward facing' (1). However, in the light of new research which shows a clearpredominancefor the orientation of most temples to the winter solstice, and other other obvious discrepancies to this sweeping generalisation, this statement can no longer to be considered valid. It seems, as with nearly all megalithic structures, that the builders had a preference for orientating their structures towards key moments of the celestial cycles. So frequent is this association that it becomes tempting to suggest that the original function of the temples may have even been to mark these events. The best evidence that the inhabitants of Malta and Gozo were interested in astronomy come in the form of discoveries of everyday objects such as this broken limestone slab from the Tal-Qadi Temple (left) which has what certainly appears to be a representation of the heavens, showing the moon  and stars as well as a number of radiating lines dividing it into quadrants, and the solar-wheel from a pottery shard found inHagar Qimtemple. With regards the temples themselves, atMnajdrain particular, there are several significant alignments to mark moments of the solar year. It is now considered probable that most, if not all of the large prehistoric temples on Malta would have originally been covered over. Combined with an invariable orientation of the passages to either the equinoxes or the solstices, the builders would have been able tousethe temples as a means of measuring the solar year exactly (in the same way as the builders of the Irish and Scottish Passage-mounds did). The feature in the photo on the left was carved in a stone beside the sea, and was presumably designed as a 'Hitching-point' for a boat. It is a curious fact that many of the Maltese temples have similar 'Hitching points' on the ground in front of the main entrances. The same design feature can also be seen on the vertical faces of stones inside the temples, where they appear to have functioned as 'door hinges', aconstruction techniquewhich can also be seen in several constructions throughoutancient Egypt. MalteseFacts-The Xewkija church on Gozo has the third largest dome in Christendom, and was built on the site of an earlier Christian structure, which in turn was built on the site of a large dolmen, last recorded in the 17th century, and which was used as the foundations of the church.(3)  Ggantija, Malta    -The   temples on Malta are claimed to be some of the oldest free-standing temples in the   world.A. Service (6), mentions the 'contemporary cement of the floor'in the pavement of the Ggantija temple on Gozo, Malta (see left), and although the idea was not accepted for a long time,Maltese archaeologists are now of the opinion thatTorba(as it is called on Malta), was formed by compacting crumbled rock and rock dust then adding water (7), creating a tough and durable rock-like material on-par with the best and strongest concrete used today. (left) One of the larger   statues, it is made from a broad shallow rectangular block of   globigerina limestone. Between the shoulders is a hole pierced   through from the front and one from the back. It seems that this   socket must have been used for the attachment of (different?)   heads to the body. In the pitted holes that cover the four sides   of the rectangular pedestal is the remains of a red pigment. The   statue was found during the restoration of 1949, with another   three headless statues and a fragment of a forth, from a hollow   under the raised threshold leading to the high room of the temple.   (centre) from Mnajdra, the back-bone and ribs are marked correctly   on the back. (Right) from Hagar Qim. Made from hard-fired buff   clay with a grey core its head and feet are broken off. The   modelling of the figurine is extremely good, especially on the   back. It was found in the first room of the temple, next to the   spiral slab, in 1839. Its size is 13 cm (5 inches) high and 6.5 cm   (2.5 inches) wide at the shoulders. The sleeping Lady from   the Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni is made of brown clay and on the   surface it has traces of red ochre. The clothed figure has   abnormally fat limbs and hips. She is naked to the waist and has a   skirt with a fringed lower part. The feet are broken away. The   wooden framework of the bed and the rush mattress is clearly   visible underneath the statuette. According to Sir Temi Zammit, it   was found in the 'snake/votive pit' in the main level of the   Hypogeum of Hal Saflieni. This limestone statuette was found during   the excavation of theXaghra Circle.   It was found close to what would have been the entrance into the   underground chambers. The obese figures lie on a 'bed' similar to   the 'bed' that supports the Hypogeum Sleeping Lady clay statuette.   On this particular 'bed', spiral designs are visible. Parts of the   body are covered with red ochre and the skirts show the remains of   black ochre. The obese couple are similar to the big statue of   Tarxien, and also have the same type of pleated dress and obese   calves. Only one head was found and it had broken from the main   body of the sculpture. On the lap of the left figure is a tiny   (also headless) obese baby figure similar to the two 'bigger'   figures. The other figure holds a small pot.  The discovery of the large   Earth-mother figure in Hal-Tarxien, near the Hypogeum confirms the   idea that the builders of the megaliths on Malta worshipped a   female deity or were governed by females.This larger-than-life female statue stands on   the right as one enters theHal-Tarxientemple complex. The top half is missing, as is the   head of several of the figurines.  'Only the photographs taken by the Maltese researcher Dr. Anton Mifsud and his colleague, Dr. Charles Savona Ventura, remain to testify the existence of the skulls and prove their abnormality. Books written by the two Maltese doctors, illustrate a collection of skulls that show peculiar abnormalities and/or pathologies. Sometimes inexistent cranial knitting lines, abnormally developed temporal partitions, drilled and swollen occiputs as following recovered traumas, but above all, a strange, lengthened skull, bigger and more peculiar than the others, lacking of the median knitting. The presence of this finding leads to a number of possible hypotheses in consideration of other finds of similar skulls, from Egypt to South America, the particular deformity, unique in the panorama of medical pathology referred to such distant times, (we are talking about approximately 3000 BC) could be an exceptional discovery. The skulls were all found in the Hal Saflienti hypogeum, where a sacred well was dedicated to the Mother Goddess and where also the small statue of a sleeping goddess was found, associated to a relic with a snake inscription on it. One in particular had a cranium showing a very pronounced dolichocephalous, in other words, a lengthened posterior part of the skullcap, besides the lack of median knitting, technically named ""sagitta"". This last detail has been considered ""impossible"" by medics and anatomists, not having analogous pathological cases in international medical literature. It is a characteristic that emphasizes the anomaly of this finding with the result of producing a natural lengthening of the cranium (not due to bandaging or boards as used in pre-Colombian civilizations)'. It is proposed, on the basis of these findings, that the group of skulls found in the Hypogeum were representative of a group of peoples who were considered of importance (as attested to by the location of their discovery), and who had a natural genetic tendency for elongated skulls, were integrally involved in the activities of the temple builders of the time. Other skulls found in theBrochtorffcircle(Hypogeum II), are considered to have had their heads bandaged in order to produce their cranial deformities.

The Hypogeum offers a unique insight into the mind of the Maltese temple builders, and the discovery of a second Hypogeum on Gozo (Hypogeum II), reinforces the image of a people preoccupied with the rituals of life and death.
Mnajdra and Hagar Qim- These two  temple complexes were constructed in close proximity of each.
They are shaped as most Maltese temples in the shape of the Earth-mother, and were built with their entrances facing towards the sea and winter solstice sun.
The obvious similarity to Hal Tarxien and the Hypogeum on Malta has led some to consider the idea that other hypogea may be one day found on Malta.
However, in the light of new research which shows a clearpredominancefor the orientation of most temples to the winter solstice, and other other obvious discrepancies to this sweeping generalisation, this statement can no longer to be considered valid.

"Maes Howe, Scotland   (Passage Mound)",Passage Mound,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/scotlandmaeshowe.htm,"Maes Howe, Scotland","The largest passage-mound in Scotland and one of the finest in Europe, Maes Howe is a small but particularly elegantly designed structure. It is distinctly different from other Orkneys 'cairns' The passage is orientated towards the setting mid-winter sun (behind the Hills of Hoy), and a blocking-stone left deliberately in the passage wall which can be opened and closed, controlled the entry of sunlight into the chamber. There are three recesses or cells in the chamber walls, set at just above waist height. A large stone lies on the floor in front of each of the cells, and these are likely to have been used as blocking. The stones for the passage and chamber have been carefully selected and dressed, and fitted together with care and precision.  The cruciform chamber in the centre of the mound is vaulted by a corbelled roof, and has three small sub-chambers leading from it. Each of these sub-chambers would have originally been covered by large blocking stones, which now lie before them on the ground. It is noticeable that the same design was used on the main entrance to the passage of the chamber itself. Cruciform chambers are found in several other passage-mounds in Europe, and other megalithic structures around the ancient (and modern) world. Their function to the builders is unknown exactly, but the association with passage mounds and astronomy may offer a clue. It is noticeable that large flattened bowls are also common in passage mounds with cruciform chambers (Knowth,DowthNewgrange)   Archaeo-astronomy: The entrance to the Maes-Howe passage-mound is orientated towards the setting winter solstice sun behind the prominent Hills of Hoy in the distance. The chamber was placed so that for several days before and after the winter solstice, the sunlight flashes directly into the passage not once, but twice, with a break of several minutes between each illumination.  All of these sites have been shown to have been deliberately constructed so as to allow the rays of the sun (and/or moon) into the interior of the passages for very specific time periods only. One of the stones from the light-box at Newgrange (right) has a particular design on it which can be found at two other passage mounds:Gavr'inisin France, andFourknocksin Ireland.At Maes Howe, the light of the setting solstice sun was restricted by the closing of a  'portal stone',  placed into the side of the passage. In this way, it is speculated that at the right moment, the stone could be closed across the passage, and the light would only pass over the top (as atNewgrange). The same design feature is also present in the entrances of the three sub-chambers, each of which also had a blocking-stone which closes most of the hole, but not all of it. (These stones now lay on the floor in front of the holes).This particular astronomical feature is similar to 'light-boxes' found in other passage mounds in Ireland and Wales (Newgrange,Carrowkeel,Bryn Celli Ddu). A similar feature is believed to have been found on the Orkneys at the recently destroyed/restoredCrantit Tomb.In contrast to the current theory above, Garnham(3)mentions that in 1861, the drawing by Gibb showed  drop in the passage roof such that only if the stone was removed would a shaft of light pass down the passage. This is due to a reconstruction of the passage which altered its original shape. He Says of it:'Very long slabs are used for the floor, ceiling and walls. These were laid on edge rather than flat and coused as in the chamber, which enhances the sense of vast size. The enormous length (12m) of the passage, it narrowness (0.7m) and low height (0.7m,but reconstructed to 1.1m).....At the entrance there are recesses to accommodate a blocking stone.

The site is likely to have been used for religious rituals. According to a late 17thC account by Edward Lhuyd, there were then fifteen stones in the circle ranging in height from three to six feet, but a further seven or eight were thought to have been 'carried off'. Apparently, there was also an entrance lined by smaller slabs.The site was partially excavated in 1938 by Professor W.F. Grimes. Unfortunately most of the records were destroyed in a bombing raid on Southampton in 1940. The plan is based partly on ground and air photographs of the excavation. Grimes established that the circle, some 60 feet in diameter, originally consisted of 17 stones which, like the two surviving ones, were set at an angle into the inner slope of the bank about 3 feet height and 120 feet in the external diameter, with no trace of a ditch. The excavations confirmed that the entrance through the earthwork was formerly flanked by upright stones, set in a trench. The bank was set with stone curb extending for some 30 feet on either side of the entrance, in front of which was a clay-filled pit containing a large quantity of charcoal. There were no features or finds recorded from the interior, though this was only partly examined. Some fragments of early Bronze Age pottery came from a hearth set in a deep depression on the southeast bank.Meini Gwyr stands at the centre of 'West Wales' most important complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age ritual and funerary monuments, lying on a ridge-way linking the wester end of the Preselis to the eastern Cleddau river and Milford Haven.

William Borlase described the monument in the 18th Century as having a triangular layout, and it has been suggested that the holed stone was moved from its earlier position to stand in a direct alignment between the two standing stones. In the mid 19th Century, a local antiquarian JT Blight proposed that the site was in fact the remains of a stone circle. This idea was given additional support when a recent site survey identified a number of recumbent stones lying just beneath the modern turf which were arranged along the circumference of a circle 18 metres in diameter. The recumbent stones are somewhat irregularly spaced but the three extant upright stones have smooth inward facing surfaces and are of a similar height to other stone circles in Penwith.If this is indeed the origin of the site, the holed stone would probably have been aligned along the circumference of the circle and would have had a special ritual significance possibly by providing a lens through which to view other sites or features in the landscape, or as a window onto other worlds. There have also been suggestions that it may have been a component of a burial chamber or cist. There are instances of burial chambers close to stone circles, as at nearby Boskednan, and a barrow mound with stone cist has been identified to the north-east of the Men-an-Tol, so it seems likely that the site was part of a more extensive ritual or ceremonial complex.Although the Men-an-Tol is considered to be Bronze Age in date no extensive excavations have taken place. The discovery of a single flaked flint by WC Borlase in 1885 is hardly compelling evidence for an early date whilst the recent works to reset the holed stone revealed only evidence for modern activity. Holed stones are found in many parts of British Isles as well as in other   countries of the world; together with holy wells they have retained the   ideas and customs associated with them more tenaciously than any other   type of ancient sites. Beliefs connected with them are remarkably similar   from the Orkneys to the far west of Cornwall. Holed stones are very rare in prehistoric Cornwall; there is only one   other comparable site, the Tolvan Stone near Gweek. All other ï¿½holed   stonesï¿½ are much smaller with holes less than 15 cm in diameter; certainly   too small to pass an infant through. These stones may have originated as   horizontally bedded stones on granite tors, the hole produced by natural weathering processes. They may have been brought to the site to fulfil a specific ritual purpose and perhaps to provide a physical link with the sacred hill.  Traditional rituals at Mï¿½n-an-Tol (centuries ago known also asDevil's Eye) involved passing naked children three times through the   holed stone and then drawing them along the grass three times in an   easterly direction. This was thought to cure scrofula (a form of   tuberculosis) and rickets. Adults seeking relief from rheumatism, spine   troubles or ague were advised to crawl through the hole nine times against   the sun. The holed stone also had prophetic qualities and, according to   nineteenth-century folklorist Robert Hunt:If two brass pins are   carefully laid across each other on the top edge of the stone, any   question put to the rock will be answered by the pins acquiring, through   some unknown agency, a peculiar motion. The Men-an-Tol has generated a wealth of folklore and tradition. It is renowned for curing many ailments, particularly rickets in children, by passing the sufferer through the hole. It was also said to provide an alternative cure ï¿½scrofulous taintï¿½, also known as the ï¿½Kings Evilï¿½ which was otherwise only curable by the touch of the reigning monarch. The siteï¿½s reputation for curing back problems earned it the name of ï¿½Crick Stoneï¿½. The stones were also seen as a charm against witchcraft or ill-wishing, and could also be used as a tool for augury or telling the future; two brass pins laid crosswise on top of each other on the top of the stone would move independently of external intervention in accordance with the question asked. Age old myths of spirits associated with sacred places are echoes from prehistory.(1)  'One of the West country's most famous archaeological landmarks is being threatened by grazing cattle permitted by the Government's environment watchdog, campaigners have warned... It is obvious that the cattle had been using the stones as convenient 'rubbing posts"", said Mr Cooke from the Penwith action group. A spokesman for English Heritage said the stones were set in concrete in the 1940's and reset in 1993 in response to concerns about soil erosion around the stones caused by visitor pressure. He added: ""We do not, however, expect cattle activity to cause damage to the stones or its setting..."" 'Napalm was   poured over two of Cornish (England) most ancient monuments   and then set ablaze. In an anonymous letter sent to The   Cornishman - the local newspaper - a group calling themselves   Friends of the Stone said they had ceremoniously burnt the   famousMen-an-Tolholed   stone and the nearbyLanyon   Quoit. The writer of the anonymous letter to The   Cornishman included three photographs of the two ancient   monuments covered in burning oil and ablaze with flames.The police at Penzance are taking the matter seriously.   ""We have to assume it is napalm, so I will be talking to the   council about getting the sites cordoned off for public safety   reasons until the monuments can be cleaned,"" one of the police   officers said. ""Until we know exactly what the substance is   that was used to burn the stones, no one should touch it, or   go near the monuments.""Cheryl Straffon, a member of Penwith Council's Sacred   Sites Committee, confirmed that the stones were indeed badly   damaged on November 5 and that the incident had been reported   to the Cornwall Archeological Unit, English Heritage and the   National Trust. She said that ""Something did occur on November   5 at the Men-an-Tol and discovered the next day. It looks as   if resin of some sort has been poured over the holed stone and   an attempt made to set it alight.""When a Cornishman reporter visited the Lanyon Quoit he   found three of the upright supports badly burnt by a blackened   substance and the huge roof stone also blacked and covered in   a sticky mess of black and white gunge.The writer of the anonymous letter stated: ""You do not   deserve the heritage these monuments hold and therefore we   intend to act further. By this time next week, Men-an-Tol will   be gone. It shall be set up again, correctly aligned with   pertinent sacred stones, in my back garden.""Anne Preston-Jones of English Heritage said that she would be   inspecting the monuments. ""I will be compiling a damage   report,"" she said. ""We can't even remove the substance until   permission is given as these are ancient monuments.""  Alignments- The circular stone aligns exactly with   the centre stone atBoscawen-Unand the church at nearby St Buryan. While this may   conceivably be coincidental, the precision of the alignment suggests an   intentional positioning of the structures in relation to each other.  ","(50.1585502, -5.6044497)",50.1585502,-5.6044497,"The original design of these megalithic remains have evoked much debate in the past, however, following the recent discovery of several recumbent stones lying beneath the turf, it is now realised that these three granite stones were once part of a stone-circle.(2) Unfortunately this popularity is not without its downside, recently someone tried to destroy the Men-an-Tol by covering it with a homemade napalm mixture and setting it on fire.
An old plan of Mï¿½n-an-Tol (the name means'stone with a hole'in Cornish) shows that originally the three main stones stood in a triangle, which makes archaeo-astronomical claims for it difficult to support.

"Merry Maidens, England",Stone Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandmerrymaidens.htm,"The Merry Maidens, England","This is the best known and preserved circle in Cornwall: it is   believed to be complete, which is rare in itself. Its nineteen granite stones are   not large (The tallest, 1.4m high, is in the south west, and the shortest   directly opposite), but neat and regular, and form a perfect circle of   23.8m (77ft 10in) diameter. The stones are regularly spaced and exactly at   the east there is a gap (an entrance or the site of a missing stone). Restoration works carried out in the middle of the 19th century replaced some of the stones incorrectly and altered the originally even spacing between the uprights. Individual stones would appear to have been carefully chosen for their shape and size. Their flat inner faces are arranged along the circumference of the circle, their tops are flat and level, and they are graded in size, the tallest stones lying in the south-west quadrant of the circle. Early reports of the site refer to traces of an earth bank, particularly noticeable around the south and west sides. There is some evidence for the existence of a second stone circle close by, although its exact location is unknown. From accounts by Dr Borlase it would have been of a similar size to the Merry Maidens, although by the 19th Century only seven remaining stones were to be seen, four of which were still upright. There are no traces of this site today.(1)  Although the Merry Maidens are also called Dawn's Men. This name has nothing to   do with sunrise: it is a corruption ofDans Maen,orStone Dancein Cornish: a story of nineteen maidens dancing on a Sunday who were   transformed into stones. The pipers that had played for them were   petrified too: the two standing stones called the Pipers are in a field to the   north-east of the circle. This legend was probably initiated by the early   Christian Church to stop the pagan Cornish peasantry continuing old   habits. Petrifaction legends (people are turned to stone), are commonly associated with stone circles, being reflected in their names, for example, the Tregeseal Dancing Stones, the Nine Maidens of Boskednan, as well as the more distantHurlersand the Pipers on Bodmin Moor.

Before the stone was re-erected the stone hole was excavated by Charlie Johns and Andy Jones of the CAU. They made the surprising discovery that the stone had originally been set at right-angles to the circle and that when restored in the 19th Century it had been turned through 90 degrees and placed in line with the circle.

"Metsamor, Armenia",Ancient Citadel,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/turkeymetsamor.htm,"Metsamor, Armenia","Metsamor is a working excavation and museum on the site of an ancient city complex with a large metallurgical and astronomical centre (occupied ca. 7,000 BC - 17th c. CE).  The site occupies a volcanic hill and surrounding area. The citadel on top of the volcanic hill is about 10.5 hectares in size, but the entire city is believed to have covered 200 hectares at its greatest extent, housing up to 50,000 people. Excavations have shown strata of occupancy going back to the Neolithic period (7,000-5,000 BC), but the most outstanding features of the site were constructed during the early, middle and late Bronze Ages (5,000-2,000 BC).  Inscriptions found within the excavation go back as far as the Neolithic period, and a sophisticated pictograph form of writing was developed as early as 2000-1800 BC.  The ï¿½Metsamor Inscriptionsï¿½ have a likeness to later scripts. Excavations began at Metsamor in 1965 and are still in progress, led by Professor Emma Khanzatian.  The most recent excavation work occurred in the summer of 1996, along the inner cyclopic wall.  Excavations have shown strata of occupancy going back to the Neolithic period (7,000-5,000 BC), but the most outstanding features of the site were constructed during the early, middle and late Bronze Ages (5000-2,000 BC).  Inscriptions found within the excavation go back as far as the Neolithic period , and a sophisticated pictograph form of writing was developed as early as 2000-1800 BC.  Metallurgy -The excavation has uncovered a large metal industry, including a foundry with 2 kinds of blast furnaces (brick and in-ground).  Metal processing at Metsamor was among the most sophisticated of its kind at that time:  the foundry extracted and processed high-grade gold, copper, several types of bronze, manganese, zinc, strychnine, mercury and iron. Metsamorï¿½s processed metal was coveted by all nearby cultures, and found its way to Egypt, Central Asia and China.  The iron smelting process was not advanced in Metsamor, probably due to the vast quantities of pure bronze alloys at hand, and Metsamor primarily mined and sold iron ore to neighbouring cultures which took better advantage of its properties.  The Foundry -The foundry dates from the Early Bronze Age (ca. 4,000 BC) though recent digs in the area uncovered signs of metal processing as early as 5,000 BC.  The complex of smelting furnaces and moulds date from the mid Bronze to Early Iron Age (3,000-2,000 BC).  The complex becomes more astounding the more you walk through it.  Several huge underground caves were uncovered that are thought to have been storehouses for base metal, as well as a granaries for winter months.  Stretching just below and around the Upper Citadel, the foundries processed Copper, Bronze, Iron, Mercury, Manganese, Strychnine, Zinc and gold.  The first iron in the ancient world was probably forged here, though it was not considered as important as bronze, giving the jump on development to the Babylonians.  Funerary remains- The discovery of thousands of people buried in simple graves and large burial mounds revealed a history of Metsamorï¿½s burial rituals and a concern for hiding wealthy tombs.  Like the Pharaohs buried in the Valley of the Kings, Metsamorï¿½s rulers tried to thwart grave robbers by hiding  the locations of royal tombs.  Fortunately the grave robbers at Metsamor were not as lucky as those in Egypt, and the Mausoleums revealed intact and richly adorned burial vaults, giving us an excellent glimpse into the traditions for preparing the body for the afterlife. Among the artefacts uncovered in the royal tombs were evidences of great wealth; Gold, silver and bronze jewellery and adornments were found over and next to the body, which was placed in a sitting foetal position in a large stone sarcophagus (early Metsamor) or lying in a casket (late Metsamor).  The bodies were laid out with their feet oriented towards the East, so they could greet the sun and follow it to the afterlife in the West.  Included in the vaults were the skeletal remains of horses, cattle, domesticated dogs and humans, presumed to be servants or slaves to the deceased.  The sacrifice of slaves and animals was a common feature of burial rituals during the Bronze and Early Iron Age, as they were considered necessary to assist their master in the next life.  In addition to jewellery, pottery and tools, excavators discovered pots filled with grape and pear piths, grains, wine and oil.  The fruit piths are a prominent part of the food offerings, and considered a necessary part of the funeral rites. Other funeral objects discovered were rare amethyst bowls, ornamented wooden caskets with inlaid covers, glazed ceramic perfume bottles, and ornaments of gold, silver and semiprecious stones, and paste decorated with traditional mythological scenes typical of local art traditions.  Egyptian, Central Asian and Babylonian objects were also found at the site, indicating that from earliest of times Metsamor was on the crossroads of travel routes spanning the Ararat plain and linking Asia Minor with the North Caucasus and Central Asia.  By the early Iron Age Metsamor was one of the ï¿½royalï¿½ towns, an administrative-political and cultural centre in the Ararat Valley.   The cyclopean walls- The walls date from the 2nd millennium BC, when the site was fortified during theUrartianEra.  The stone blocks average 20 tons in weight, and are more than 3 meters thick in places. During the Middle Bronze Period (late 3rd to mid 2nd millennium BC) there was a surge of urban growth and a development of complex architectural forms which extended the boundaries of the settlement to the area below the hill.  Basically, that area within the inner cyclopean walls are the older city, and that beyond represent newer areas.  By the 11th c. BC the central city occupied the lowlands stretching to Lake Akna, and covered 100 hectares (247 acres).   Inscriptions- En route to the temple site, just below the old citadel, is an incline on the stone hill.  Carved into the hill is an intricate and large (almost 20 meters long) design.  The design resembles a rudimentary map, and the shape of the rock resembles the Ararat side of Mt. Aragats in miniature.  Inscriptions also include several early Haikassian script symbols (though carved at Metsamor much earlier, ca. 3,000 BC), and forms one of the basis' for establishing the old Armenian script during the Bronze Age around Metsamor. Three temples were uncovered and are now covered by a metal structure, Vandals have desecrated most of the altars you see.  Luckily they are only three of an entire complex that was preserved by recovering them after the initial dig in 1967.   The temples are unlike any other uncovered in Western Asia and the Ancient world, indicating a very distinct culture at Metsamor during the 2nd-1st millennia. Within the altar spaces are numerous bowls set into the temple floor and a complex series of clay holders.  Very little is understood about the ritual that occurred here, though animal sacrifice was a part.  The holders probably held rare oil mixed with myrrh and frankincense, purified wine, wheat and fruit (seeds were discovered in some of the shallow bowls).    It should be no     surprise to anyone who knows something of Armenia's history that     astronomy is such an important part of the national character.     Sun symbols, signs of the zodiac, and ancient calendars     predominated in the region while the rest of the world was just     coming alive, culturally speaking. Egypt and China were still     untamed wilderness areas when the first cosmic symbols began     appearing on the side of the Geghama Mountain Range around 7000     BC. At Metsamor (ca 5000 BC), one of the oldest observatories in     the world can be found. It sits on the southern edge of the     excavated city, a promontory of red volcanic rocks that juts out     like the mast of a great ship into the heavens. Between 2800 and     2500 BCE at least three observatory platforms were carved from     the rocks. The Metsamor observatory is an open book of ancient     astronomy and sacred geometry. For the average visitor the     carvings are indecipherable messages. With Elma Parsamian, the     first to unlock the secrets of the Metsamor observatory as a     guide, the world of the first astronomers comes alive. The discovery of the astronomical 'observatory' at Metsamor and the presence of engravings which have been speculatively called 'zodiac creatures' has given credence to the assertion that the ancient figures of the constellations were probably created by ancient peoples living in the Euphrates valley and near Mount Ararat in eastern Anatolia and Armenia: Rick Ney, the author ofKarahundj, The Armenian Stonehenge, says of it: ""Parsamian's discovery at Metsamor, and the stones at Sissian give concrete credence to Maunder's and Olkott's theories, especially when coupled with ca. 4,000ï¿½3,000 BC stone carvings of zodiac figures on rocks on the Geghama Mountain Range in Armenia."". ""The Metsamorians were a trade culture,"" Parsamian explains.     ""For trade, you have to have astronomy, to know how to     navigate."" The numerous inscriptions found at Metsamor puzzled     excavators, as indecipherable as they were elaborate. Hundreds     of small circular bowls were carved on the rock surfaces,     connected by thin troughs or indented lines. But one stood out.     It is an odd shaped design that was a mystery to the excavators     of the site, until Professor Parsamian discovered it was a key     component to the large observatory complex. By taking a modern     compass and placing it on the     carving, Parsamian found that it pointed due North, South and     East. It was one of the first compasses used in Ancient times.Another carving on the platforms shows four stars inside a     trapezium. The imaginary end point of a line dissecting the     trapezium matches the location of star which gave rise to     Egyptian, Babylonian and ancient Armenian religious worship. The Observatory-The observatory rivals the discoveries at the citadel for importance, substantiating theories on the birthplace of the zodiac and origins of astronomy in the ancient world.  Dated ca. 2,800-2,500 BC, when the zodiac is figured to have been concluded, the observatory was also the primary religious site and navigation centre for the Metsamorian culture.  Hundreds of shallow bowls are carved onto the surfaces of three large rocks that rise above the surrounding river delta.  The use of the bowls are unknown, many are linked by equally shallow ""canals"" (we're talking real small here, no more than a few inches in diameter for the bowls).  They might have been filled with oil that was lit at night as part of a ritual celebration (if so, they would look very much like a 'bowl of the universe'  on earth), or they may have been used to smelt and forge metal in another sort of ritual.  Imagination allows you to decide for yourself. The author,   accompanied by P.Herouni, his collaborators and two students from Moscow, spent the whole of 24 June, 2001, that is, two days after the summer solstice, on the spot from about 5 AM until midnight, and was able to observe and record with his personal video camera the rising of the Sun and the Moon. He witnessed that three or four of the holes are directed towards the point of sunrise while an equal number of other holes are oriented towards the point of sunset on the day of the summer solstice. The same is true of the points of the moon rising and setting on the day when the observations took place.  ""Sirius is most probably the star     worshipped by the ancient inhabitants of Metsamor,"" Parsamian     explains. ""Between 2800-2600 BCE Sirius could have been observed     from Metsamor in the rising rays of the sun. It is possible     that, like the ancient Egyptians, the inhabitants of Metsamor     related the first appearance of Sirius with the opening of the     year.""Those wanting to plot the same event from Metsamor will have to     wait a while. Sirius now appears in the winter sky, while the     inhabitants of Metsamor observed it in the summer. (Because of     the earth's rotation within the rotation of the Milky Way     galaxy, stars change their positions over time. In another 4000     years or so Sirius will again appear as it is plotted on the     Metsamor stellar map).The Metsamorians also left behind a calendar divided into twelve     months, and made allowances for the leap year. Like the Egyptian     calendar which had 365 days, every four years the Metsamorians     had to shift Sirius' rising from one day of the month to the     next.""There is so much I found in 1966,"" Parsamian adds, ""and so much     we do not know. We believe they worshipped the star Sirius, but     how? I like to imagine there was a procession of people holding     lights. These carved holes throughout the complex may have been     filled with oil and lit. Just imagine what it must have looked     like with all those little fires going all over the steps of the     observatory. Like a little constellation down on earth.""Parsamian has a special regard for Metsamor, since it was she     who uncovered many of the mysteries of the inscriptions on the     observatory, answers which explained other finds uncovered at     the excavation site. ""When you walk over this ancient place, you     can use your imagination to complete the picture. I love to     visit Metsamor since I feel I am returning to the ancients."" Livvio Stecchini noted the curious fact thatThebesin Egypt     is geometrically aligned with Mt. Ararat, and the oracle centre calledDodonain Greece, both of which are recorded as resting places for the Ark, following the 'great flood'. He showed that the three sites are equidistant from each other, forming  an equilateral triangle. This idea was later followed up by Robert Temple, who suggested that the nearby Metsamor was a more appropriate location as it is more accurately positioned than Ararat. The discoveries of advanced astronomy and geometry at this site, support the conclusion that Metsamor was once an important oracle centre.

Like the Egyptian     calendar which had 365 days, every four years the Metsamorians     had to shift Sirius' rising from one day of the month to the     next.""There is so much I found in 1966,"" Parsamian adds, ""and so much     we do not know.
Like a little constellation down on earth.""Parsamian has a special regard for Metsamor, since it was she     who uncovered many of the mysteries of the inscriptions on the     observatory, answers which explained other finds uncovered at     the excavation site.

"Mirador, Guatemala",Pyramid Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/guatemalamirador.htm,"El Mirador, Guatemala","The Mayan pyramid complex of Mirador is being resuscitated from a near-death experience following a thousand years of assault by the jungles of the Guatemalan highlands. This fantastic temple complex is now realised to contain the largest pyramid on the American continent, and probably the whole world (in terms of mass). The Mirador Basin in the far northern Petï¿½n region of Guatemala is known for its abundance of sites, many of which are among the largest and earliest in the Maya world. Of 26 known sites, only 14 have been studied; an estimated 30 more await discovery. Since 2003, Global Heritage Fund (GHF) has been working in Mirador to protect its priceless ancient cities and monuments and preserve the site for future generations. Led by project director Dr. Richard Hansen, founder and president of the Foundation for Anthropological Research and Environmental Studies (FARES), GHF has established a new 880,000-acre national park in the area, and continues to work with local communities like nearby Carmelita to ensure Miradorï¿½s integrity and sustainability. In 2010, after completion of site conservation, El Mirador opened to the public for the first time.(2) El Mirador was first discovered in 1926, and was photographed from the air in 1930, but the remote site deep in the jungle had little more attention paid to it until Ian Graham spent some time there making the first map of the area in 1962 A detailed investigation was begun in 1978. To the surprise of the archaeologists, it was found that a large amount of construction was not contemporary with the large Maya classic cities in the area, like Tikal and Uaxactun, but rather from centuries earlier in the Pre-Classic era. The civic centre of the site covers some 10 square miles (26 km2) with several thousand structures, including monumental architecture from 10 to 30 meters high. Most of the structures were originally faced with cut stone which was then decorated with largestucco masks depicting the deities ofMaya mythology. According toCarlos Morales-Aguilar, a Guatemalan archaeologist, the city appears to have been planned from its foundation, as extraordinary alignments have been found between the architectural groups and main temples, which were possibly related to solar alignments. The study reflects an importance of urban planning and sacred spaces since the first settlers. An additional feature of El Mirador is the quantity and size of causeways (see above), internally linking important architectural compounds, and externally linking the numerous major ancient cities within the Mirador Basin during the latter part of the Middle and LatePreclassic periods. The causeways were known anciently assacbeob(the plural form ofsacbe, meaning ""white road"" inMayan, fromsac""white"" andbe""road""). These are raised stone causeways raising 2 to 6 meters above the level of the surroundinglandscape and measuring from 20 to 50 meters wide. Onesacbelinks El Mirador to the neighbouring site of Nakbe, approximately 12 km away, while another joined El Mirador toEl Tintal, 40 km away. This causeway has been scientifically excavated nd is the longest in Mesoamerica.(4) This large concentration of Preclassic Maya cities in Mesoamerica is threatened by massive deforestation, looting, and destruction caused by equipment used in logging road construction, which itself facilitates intrusive settlements. La Danta is 230 ft high (70m), and is the largest structure ever built by the Mayans. El Tigre pyramid is only 180 ft high, (55m), yet from the top one still looks over the treetops in the Mirador Basin.  The El Tigre and La Danta complexes face each other on an East-West axis. The architecture is characterized by triadic structures composed of one large temple pyramid flanked on either side by two smaller pyramids, a pattern that is repeated elsewhere in the Pre-classic sites of the Mirador basin. The colossalLa Danta Complexlies to the east of the main plaza and Central Acropolis. Although technically lower than El Tigre, it rises to a height of 70 meters (230 feet) thanks to its elevated location on a hillside, making it the tallest structure in the Mayan world. Its base is equally impressive. There are jaguar and vulture heads built into the sides of the smaller temples here and the spectacular views from the top of the pyramid afford views of nearby Mayan sites, including Nakbï¿½ and Calakmul. El Tigre complex is  believed to be the site where rulers once performed human and animal sacrifices. The structures are decorated with large stucco masks and panels depicting deities of Mayan mythology. The base of theEl Tigre Complexis as large as three football fields, while the large temple dominating the structure reaches 180 ft. (55m) in height. The lower flanking pyramids contain gigantic stucco jaguar masks. The cityï¿½sCentral Acropolistakes the form of a narrow plaza bordered on one side by a series of small buildings. Moving south from the El Tigre Complex, you come to theMonos Complex,only 138 ft high (45m), another triadic structure named after the howler monkeys tending to congregate in this area. While investigating the water collection system at the city of El Mirador in northern Guatemala's Petï¿½n rain forest, a team of archaeologists led by Richard Hansen of Idaho State University uncovered a sculptural panel with one of the earliest depictions of the Maya creation story, the Popol Vuh. ""It was like finding the Mona Lisa in the sewage system,"" says Hansen. The plaster panel dates to approximately 200 B.C. and depicts the mythical hero twins, Hunaphu and Xbalanque, swimming into the underworld to retrieve the decapitated head of their father. The sculpture dates to the same period as some of the earliest artwork to depict the Popol Vuh, the murals at San Bartolo and a stela at Nakbe, two other nearby cities. Parts of the decorative panel extend beyond Hansen's excavation trench, so uncovering the rest of it will have to wait until next field season. In the meantime, the archaeologists have installed a climate-controlled shelter over the area to ensure the plaster remains intact. This importance of this discovery (dated at approximately 200 BC)(3), is such that it changes the whole view of the Mayan belief system. The Popol Vuh is the Mayan creation myth, and similarities with 'Old World' creation myths have led to it traditionally been viewed as having been 'tainted' by the Catholic church following the 'conquest' of the Americas. This discovery of the Popol Vuh from around 1000 years before the conquistadors clearly isolates it from outside influences, giving it a credence in its own right. The sculpture decorates the wall of a channel that was meant to funnel rainwater through the central administrative area of the city. According to Hansen, every roof and plaza in the city was designed to guide rainwater into reservoirs. While a rain forest may not seem like a place where drought would be a problem, the Mirador Basin gets very little rain from January through May, which would have made it difficult to maintain a large urban population.(3)  While it is understood thatthere are at least 30  cities,  dating from the pre-classic 1000 BC to 300 AD in the Mirador basin, in El Mirador an early uncorrected carbon date from a filling in El Tigre complex, of 1480 BC (beta 1964) is not associated with known ceramics of this period and would have been considered erroneous except that several other samples have been recovered from throughout the site from this general time period, including Zea Mais (Corn) from 2,700 BC in Lake Puerto Arturo, nearby.  (Matheny and Matheny 1991) (Wahl, 2004).(4)  ","(15.783471, -90.23075899999999)",15.783471,-90.23075899999999,"The Mayan pyramid complex of Mirador is being resuscitated from a near-death experience following a thousand years of assault by the jungles of the Guatemalan highlands.

"Mohenjo Daro, Pakistan",Indus Valley Citadel,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/Pakistanmohenjo.htm,Mohenjo Daro,"Mohenjo-Daro was a city located in the south of Modern   Pakistan in the Sindh Province, on the right bank of the Indus River. It   was built between four and five thousand years ago, and lasted until 3,700   BP. It was part of the Harrapan Civilization, and at its peak, the city had at least   35,000 residents. This was a sophisticated society with a wide-ranging   diet that consisted of meat from both wild and domesticated animals and a   variety of cultivated wheat, barley, peas and lentils ï¿½ a huge step   forward in human progression from the nomadic hunter-gatherers. 'The salt content of the ground water is eating away at the bricks that, before excavation, had survived thousands of years...Even the Mohenjo Daro Museum has been looted, with many of its famous seals among the artefacts stolen...""most of the attempts at conservation by the authorities have been so bad and so amateur they have only accelerated the damage""...Some experts have gone so far as to suggest that the entire site should be buried again to halt its decline..' Mohenjo Daro is probably the best known of the Indus Valley civilisationcities. Similar in style and date to Harappa in north Pakistan, it was built almost entirely of kiln-fired bricks between 2,500 and 2,100 BC(12). Originally square in outline, the City was laid out along the lines of a grid. Twelve main streets divided it, of which eleven blocks were residential with the twelfth section being dominated by the Citadel. The city had a sophisticated sewage system with regular manhole covers. Public latrines for every block and sewers large enough to walk in.(1)House drains, which were enclosed systems, were made of clay pipes and were connected to the sewers by open brick gutters. An archaeological site dating back about 5,500 years and believed   to be older than Mohenjo daro has been found in Pakistan's southern   Sindh province. A team of 22 archaeologists found some   semi-precious and precious stones and utensils made of clay,   copper and other metals during an excavation at the site in   Lakhian Jo Daro in Sukkur district.""At present, we can say that it (the site) is older than   Mohen jodaro,"" Ghulam Mustafa Shar, the director of the Lakhian Jo   Daro project said. The find is believed to date back to the Kot   Diji era, experts said. Shar said the remains of a 'faience' or   tin-glazed pottery factory had been found at the site. It is   believed to be of the era of mirror factories in Italy that date   back to some 9,000 years. A painting has also been found at the   site and the discovery of more such items could establish the site   as 9,000 years old, like the remains found at Mehargarh in   Balochistan and Jericho in Palestine, Shar said.  One of the most spectacular structures at Mohenjo is the 'Great Bath', which is astonishingly well preserved and measures 180 feet north to south and 108 feet east to west. It is described as a ï¿½vast hydropathic establishment and the most imposing of all the remains unearthed at Mohenjo-Daro,ï¿½ by Sir Marshall.(17) ï¿½Its plan is simple: in the centre, an open quadrangle with verandahs on its four sides, and at the back of three of the verandahs various galleries and rooms; on the south, a long gallery with a small chamber in each corner; on the east, a single range of small chambers, including one with a well; on the north a group of several halls and fair-sized room. In the midst of the open quadrangle is a large swimming-bath, some 39 feet long by 23 feet broad and sunk about 8 feet below the paving of the court, with a flight of steps at either end, and at the foot of each a low platform for the convenience of bathers, who might otherwise have found the water too deep. The bath was filled from the wellï¿½, and the waste water was carried off through a covered drainï¿½The Great Bath had a least one upper storeyas evidenced by a stairway. A large amount of timber, possibly richly carved, must have gone to the building of the upper storey, judging from the quantities of charcoal and ashes found in the course of excavation"". More than a thousand settlements are now known from the Indus valley civilisation. The civilisation is known to have had a unity of culture, art, script, and technology (even weights and measures). The largest city, Mohenjo Daro is thought to have reached a population of approximately 30,000, suggesting a total population of approximately 5 million people.(1) It was the largest of the four ancient civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China. However, of all these civilizations the least is known about the Indus Valley people. This is because the Indus script has not yet been deciphered. There are many remnants of the script on pottery vessels, seals, and amulets, but without a ""Rosetta Stone"" linguists and archaeologists have been unable to decipher it. An additional indicators of this is that the bricks used to build at these Indus cities are all uniform in size ( Stone ï¿½sealsï¿½ with intricate carving were found (see below), that correspond to similar Iraqi seals from the mid-third millennium BC.(1).Some of the seals found were almost exact the same as those found in ancient Sumerian sites.  Ancient Mesopotamian texts speak of trading with at least two seafaring civilizations - Makkan and Meluha - in the neighbourhood of India in the third millennium B.C. This trade was conducted with real financial sophistication in amounts that could involve tons of copper. The Mesopotamians speak of Meluha as an aquatic culture, where water and bathing played a central role. A number of Indus Valley objects have been found buried with Mesopotamians. The ancient script of the Indus valley people has been found in another location,Easter Island; which is exactly diametrically opposed to Mohenjo daro. This curious coincidence has yet to be properly explained. The Indus Valley Culture was extant thousands of years before the Easter Island culture began, yet the similarity between the two scripts is uncanny. A team led by a University of     Washington researcher has used computers to extract patterns in     ancient Indus symbols. The study, published this week in the     Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows distinct     patterns in the symbols' placement in sequences and creates a     statistical model for the unknown language. Despite dozens of attempts,     nobody has yet deciphered the Indus script. The symbols are     found on tiny seals, tablets and amulets, left by people     inhabiting the Indus Valley from about 2600 to 1900 B.C. Each     artefact is inscribed with a sequence that is typically five to     six symbols long. Some people have questioned     whether the symbols represent a language at all, or are merely     pictograms of political or religious icons. The new study looks for     mathematical patterns in the sequence of symbols. Calculations     show that the order of symbols is meaningful; taking one symbol     from a sequence found on an artefact and changing its position     produces a new sequence that has a much lower probability of     belonging to the hypothetical language. The authors said the     presence of such distinct rules for sequencing symbols provides     further support for the group's previous findings, reported     earlier this year in the journal Science, that the unknown     script might represent a language. Seals with sequences of Indus     symbols have been found as far away as West Asia, in the region     historically known as Mesopotamia and site of modern-day Iraq.     The statistical results showed that the West-Asian sequences are     ordered differently from sequences on artefacts found in the     Indus valley. This supports earlier theories that the script may     have been used by Indus traders in West Asia to represent     different information compared to the Indus region.    Several Copper and Bronze objects have been discovered at Mohenjo Daro, they were first cast and then hammered to required shape. Stone axes and flake-knives have also been found in several houses of Mohenjo-Daro illustrating that the city witnessed the transition from 'stone-age' to 'Bronze-age'.  For several years, it was insinuated that a devastating event had occurred at Mohenjo daro, killing everyone on the spot. The 'War of the Gods' in the Mahabharata was said to be historical narrative of a nuclear explosion. Although archaeology on the site only revealed 37 bodies in ten years digging, and at different levels of occupation(3), and there are no reports to substantiate suggestions of a higher than normal level of background radiation, the myth still lingers on.

"Monsaraz, Portugal",Stone Quadrangle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portomonsaraz.htm,"Monsaraz, Portugal","There are several worthwhile megaliths surrounding the peak of Monsaraz; or 'Mont-Xarez', which dominates the otherwise flat landscape in every direction. Over 130 sites have been recorded in the surrounding countryside The Xerez (Xarez) menhir / Stone-circle (quadrangle):Originally 5 km south of Monsaraz, the reconstitution of theXarez stone-circle beside the Convento do Oradawas only possible after some research since the original monoliths had been spread apart by  agricultural works. Today we are greeted with around 50 medium-sized rounded stones in an approximate square formation, centred with a 4m+ high, 7-ton menhir. The site plaque states that:'The Whole group had been artificially put together in the 20th century, resulting from the collection and arrangement of small monoliths and manual grindstones around the great menhir, which is 4m high'. The   research by Dr. Pires Gonï¿½alves   in the 1970's concluded that the monument was probably erected   between 4,000 BC and 3,000 BC and that its original design had   been quadrangular, consisting of 55 menhirs between 1.2 - 1.5   metres high. The stones are described as being both phallic and   rounded as at Almendres. It took Gonï¿½alves until 1972 to complete   the reconstruction. The azimuth of 100ï¿½ between Almendres and Xarez cromeleques has also been tentatively suggested as having been related to the azimuth of the full spring moon(3). Of interest is the fact that the spectacularAnta Grande da Zambujeiroalso sits along the same proposed 50km 'alignment', although none of the sites are inter-visible. The same alignment continues eastwards towards Lisbon.  Da Silva and Calado proposed that: 'A very simple observation could have been realized in megalithic times, in which the azimuths of the rising Sun and of the rising Full Moon, after Midwinter, are getting closer until they cross-over, i.e. until the Full Moon is seen to rise South of the direction in which the Sun was observed to rise in the same day. We know that this occurs about the time of the Equinox, and this cross-over may be used to provide an alternative definition of the ""megalithic equinox"". (5) There are several prominent engravings stilljustvisible on the upper-half of the menhir including a 'sun' shaped symbol, several 'crook's', and 'serpentine-wavy' lines), familiar only in style to the engravings insideGavr'inispassage-mound in France, similarly dated at around 4,500 BC).

The stone weighs around 8 tons and was beautifully shaped and erected to lead an apparently solitary life in the flatlands, with Monsaraz alone looming in the background. There is a slight depression along the top which has led to the common assumption that it was originally phallic by design.  The 'Roche das Namorados' is actually a natural granite outcrop. It is occasionally referred to as 'mushroom-shaped' or 'Uterus' shaped, but its shape varies depending on where one stands. The stone has several large 'dimples' or 'cup-marks' on it, a common feature on Neolithic remains, although there is no way of proving their origin or meaning.

"Mont St Michel, France",Pilgrimage Site,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/francemontstmichel.htm,"Mont St Michel, France","Rising to over 500 ft high, the Island of Mont St. Michel silhouettes the sky creating a living work of art of gigantic proportions on a canvas of sky, rock and sea. The site has remained a religious sanctuary since at least the middle-ages, and became an important European pilgrimage site (for Miquelots). The island is composed of granite, along with several others in the area, which stand out in what is generally a low-lying country.(2) According to legend, an enormous tidal wave swept over the area, transforming it completely at the beginning of the 8th century.From the middle ages onwards, the island was dedicated to the worship of the archangelSaint-Michael. In 708 AD, following several visions, the Bishop Aubert sent messengers to Monte Gargano to return with sacred objects (a piece of his red cloak, and a fragment of the alter where he had placed his feet), in order to sanctify the rock and its establishments.(2). Each century since then, the buildings have gained in size and grandeur, reaching their present stature.  The main section of the structure is orientated at 26ï¿½north of true-east (the same as that of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris). This orientation can be followed in both directions creating an alignment withMont Dolto the SW (The place where St. Michael is reputed to have fought Lucifer), and to d'Avranches to the SE (The original home of Bishop Aubert, to whom St. Michael appeared and ordered the rock dedicated in his name).  As well as the alignment above, which is clearly solar in nature. Mont St. Michel is also claimed to be aligned to several other sites dedicated to St. Michael. It is said to run from Mont Carmel in Israel (the rock of the prophet Eli), then passes throughDelosandDelphi(bothoracle sitesdedicated to Apollo), Corfu (where Artemis, the sister of Apollo lived), Monte Gargano in Italy (the primary European sanctuary of St. Michael and where he appeared several times), La Sacra di San Michele in Piï¿½mont, the celebrated Benedictine monastery over 1000m high, Mont St. Michel in Normandy, Saint Michael's mount off the point of Cornwall, and Skellig Michael, an island to the south of Ireland(1).

"Monte Alban, Mexico",Mountain Citadel,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicomontealban.htm,"Monte Alban, Mexico","The levelled hilltop on Monte Alban is the heart of the second largest ceremonial site in Mesoamerica, and is exceeded in size only byTeotihuacï¿½n. It is believed to have supported up to 35,000 people in its heyday, revealing it as an important part of the pre-Columbian American landscape. Although this was one of the most enduring of all the  civilizations of Mexico (lasting from about 500 B.C. to 800 AD), it experienced a sudden and rapid decline at the same time as the collapse of other pre-Columbian cities elsewhere in Mexico. Believed to have been built around 600 BC, the huge complex of ceremonial buildings on top of Monte Alban mountain has some of the most oddly shaped structures of the ancient world. Not only was much of the stone brought up from the valley floor, so was all the water, as the site has no visible natural source.Blanton's survey of the site (1), suggests that the Monte Albï¿½n hill itself appear to have been uninhabited prior to 500 BC  although the valley is now believed to have been continuously occupied since 2000 BC There are a The earliest Zapotec city was San Jose el Mogote, also in the Oaxaca Valley and founded about 1600-1400 BC; it was abandoned around 500 BC, when the capital city of Monte Albï¿½n was founded at the beginning of the Zapotec heyday. The Zapotecs built their new capital city in the middle of the valley of Oaxaca, between three populous valley arms and at the top of this steep hill. Building a city away from major population centres is called 'disembedded capital' by some archaeologists, and Monte Alban is one of very few disembedded capitals known in the ancient world.San Josï¿½ Mogote is a pre-Columbian archaeological site of the Zapotec, a Mesoamerican culture that flourished in the region of what is now the Mexican state of Oaxaca.

Monte Alban Period 2(200   BC to 1 AD) is characterized by an   influx of a group of people from Chiapas or Guatemala who were smaller   in numbers, but introduced changes as they merged with the resident   population. Between Monte Alban Period 2(200 BC to 1 AD)and 3A(100 AD to   400 AD) there is evidence of influence from and trade with Teotihuacan   to the North. Between Monte Alban Period 3A(100 AD to 400 AD)and 3B(400 AD To   700 AD) the vast majority of the city was reconstructed. Monte Alban Period 4(800 AD To Spaniards) is the beginning of the   decline of Monte Alban as a major power base in the area. Monte Alban Period 5reflects the influence of the Mixtec   occupation. It is known that the history of the region started around 4000 years ago when a village-dwelling people of unknown origin (suggested by some to have been Olmec colonies) moved into the Oaxaca valleys. Then, around 500 BC (1500 years later) a new people (theZapotecans) moved into the region. One of these groups then began the monumental task of levelling the top of a 1,600 meter high mountain that intersects and divides three valley, and built Monte Alban with a maze of subterranean passage ways, rooms, drainage and water storage systems. Archaeologists may still argue over who founded Monte Alban (in spite of the oldest reliefs which are clearly Olmec), but what they do agree on is that in the following centuries, theZapotecans(the new people to move into the area) were responsible for the distinct architectural style and rise to power of Monte Alban (which coincides with the exact time period that the powerful, war-like Olmec civilization went into full-scale decline). It is difficult to believe that any group other than the long established governing power which controlled the population and resources of the valleys below would be able to complete the task of building Monte Alban, or that they would allow a new group of people to move right into the middle of their territory and take up a dominant military position on the strategic high ground controlling three valleys. The oldest known structure at Monte Alban is known as The Gallery of the Dancers. The glyphs depict naked warriors, ejaculation, childbirth, dwarfism, captives, the sick, genitally mutilated and the dead with contorted body positions (like dancers). These pictures  are the oldest artefacts found here and date back to the origins of the city itself. The distinct artistic style, and the features of the people with round mongoloid facial features and beards is pure Olmec. The meanings of these  symbols, people, positions, or historical context is open to interpretation. One of the strongest characteristics of Monte Albï¿½n is the large number of carved stone monuments one encounters throughout the plaza. The earliest examples, the so-called ""Danzantes"" (literally, dancers), were found mostly in the vicinity of Building L. The 19th century notion that they depict dancers is now largely discredited, and these monuments, dating to the earliest period of occupation at the site (Monte Albï¿½n I), clearly represent tortured, sacrificed war prisoners, some identified by name, and may depict leaders of competing centres and villages captured by Monte Albï¿½n (Marcus and Flannery 1996; Blanton et al. 1996). A different type of carved stones is found on the nearby Building J in the centre of the Main Plaza, a building characterized by an unusual arrow-like shape and an orientation that differs from most other structures at the site. Inserted within the building walls are over 40 large carved slabs dating to Monte Albï¿½n II and depicting place-names, occasionally accompanied by additional writing and in many cases characterized by upside-down heads. Alfonso Caso was the first to identify these stones as ""conquest slabs"", likely listing places the Monte Albï¿½n elites claimed to have conquered and/or controlled. Some of the places listed on Building J slabs have been tentatively identified, and in one case (the Caï¿½ada de Cuicatlï¿½n region in northern Oaxaca) Zapotec conquest has been confirmed through archaeological survey and excavations (Redmond 1983; Spencer 1982). The archaeo-astronomer Anthony Aveni has shown how the building's front doorway is precisely aligned with the point where the bright star Capella (the sixth brightest in the sky) would have first appeared in the dawn sky each year, on  the same day that the sun reached its first of two annual zenith days over Monte Alban, on each of which it casts no shadow at mid-day. The front stairway of J is aligned in turn with Structure P (on the eastern side of the plaza), which has aunique vertical shaftleading down into a chamber down which the sun would have shone with no shadow on that same day. Crossed-stick symbols found on Structure J lend further support to the importance of astronomical sighting-stick observations from this position. Moreover, the asymmetric plan of Structure J turns out to be precisely aligned with the point to the west where 5 of the 25 brightest stars in the sky, including the Southern Cross, first rise above the horizon. The perpendicular to Structure J's baseline shoots through what was an opening or doorway in Structure P points northeast to where the bright star Capella was seen to rise in the processional era of 275 B.C.  During this time Capella made its first reappearance in the predawn sky (its heliacal rise) on May 8, which is the first solar zenith passage date at the latitude of Monte Alban. Solar zenith passages (when the sun passes through the zenith at high noon) were important indicators of the zenith centre. Solar zenith passages occur only within the Tropics, that is between latitudes 23.5 degrees S and 23.5 degrees N. Amazingly platform Structure B through which the Capella observations were sighted, houses Monte Alban's famous zenith tube. This vertical tube leads into an underground chamber where zenith passage measurements of the sun and stars could be made. Zenith tubes have been found at other sites, such as Xochicalco in Central Mexico.

"Mycenae, Greece (",Mycenaean Capital,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/greecemycenae.htm,"Mycenae, Greece","In the second millennium BC Mycenae was one of the major centres of Greek civilization and a military stronghold which would have dominated much of southern Greece. The Mycenaean civilization filled the vacuum of the Minoans following the Santorini disaster in the 16th cent BC. There are several indications that they originated from the middle east (Phrygia). Article: May. 2013:'Mysterious Mayans Were European According to DNA' The Minoans, the builders of Europe's first advanced civilization, really were European, new research suggests. The conclusion, published today (May 14) in the journal Nature Communications, was drawn by comparing DNA from 4,000-year-old Minoan skeletons with genetic material from people living throughout Europe and Africa in the past and today.  Article: Oct. 2009:'The Worlds Oldest   Submerged Town'- Archaeologists surveying the worldï¿½s oldest submerged town have found   ceramics dating back to the Final Neolithic. Their discovery suggests   thatPavlopetri, off the southern Laconia coast of Greece, was   occupied some 5,000 years ago ï¿½ at least 1,200 years earlier than   originally thought. Greek legend always maintains that the Pelopidae of Mycenae came from Phyrgia, which is corroborated by  archaeology. The objects found in excavations, and the sculptured ornament on the doorways of the ""Treasuries"" and over the Lion Gate, all point to foreign influence and particularly to Asia Minor. The same type of the two lions and the column has been recently found over the entrance to a colossal sepulchre in the rocks near the south-western corner of the Sangarius valley in Phyrgia. Legend and remains alike show that a rich and powerful dynasty of foreign origin ruled at Mycenae; the only early remains in the Greek world that equal them in interest are the ruins of ancient Troy. It is precisely these two cities which are described in the Homeric poems as the two great cities of the Greek world. The primary entrance to the city is flanked on either side by the city wall. Over the entrance is placed a triangular slab of stone into which the now famous carved  lions  face one another, separated by an upright column. The art of this relief shows no resemblance to archaic Greek art; in is foreign in character, the work of immigrant race, which brought with it a well-developed civilization. In the 19th and early 20th centuries some scholars ascribed many of these walls and buildings to the ancientPelasgians, but  their history was so hard to unravel most modern works make almost no reference to them. At most, modern textbooks consider them to be the earliest inhabitants of Greecebeforethe invasion of the Mycenaeans. In fact it appears that the term Mycenaeans was invented to replace these hard to trace Pelasgians - as noted by Professor William Ridgeway inThe Early Age of Greece.  Nine significantTholoihave been discovered in ancient Mycenae, with the so-called 'Treasury of Atreus' being the most impressive. Tholoi are characterised by their internal domed chamber, normally referred to as 'Beehive-shaped'. Numerous other 'Tholoi' are recorded around the Mediterranean and the Middle-east, where they were commonly used for burial, but in some cases they were used for other purposes such as homes (Cyprus), ritual (Syria), and even fortification (Spain, Sardinia). The ultimate origin of this architectural technique can be seen in both the Neolithic cultures of Tell Halaf (Syria and Turkey), with echoes in the Neolithic Western-Atlantic passage-mounds.  '...all these tombs, great as well as small, were once closed; the only question is when it was done. As both the greattholoiat Mycenae were provided with rich faï¿½ades and had their wooden doors overlaid with metals, it appears to me more probable that they were not forthwith blocked up. . . . it is the fact that the walls, built to block up the two greattholoi, are not of the same material as the tombs themselves'. -- Dorpfeld's Introduction toThe Mycenaean Age -- A Study of the Monuments and Culture of Prehomeric Greeceby Chrestos Tsountas and J. Irving Manatt (1897), pp. xxvi-xxvii As a rule, the body was simply laid on the floor of thetholosor the chamber, not covered with earth nor placed in a coffin of wood or stone, of which not a trace has yet been found. . . . For repeated observations prove that, as often as the area of the chamber or the tholos became crowded with corpses, the earlier remains were gathered in heaps in the corners, or buried in shallow trenches, so as to make room for the new interments. -- Ibid., pp. 136-7 Following the death of the last member of the Perseid dynasty, the Mycenaean's went to the oracle at Delphi, who told them to summon Atreus and Theyestes, the two sons of Pelops, in order to choose on of them as a king. Atreus won their favour and ascended the throne of Mycenae, however, he quarrelled with his brother, who plotted against him with the help of Atreus' wife, Aerope, who was also his lover. To avenge himself, Atreus invited him to dinner where he offered Thyestes the flesh of his sons, thus bringing upon himself a curse blighting his destiny and that of all the offspring.  However, the date for the erection of the bluestones at Stonehenge has since been revised, as pointed out in the book Hengeworld by Mike Pitts, (0-09-927875-8), on page 341 he states that the ""large sarsen structures"" of Stonehenge have been dated with 95% confidence to between 2461 & 2205 bce., at the inside more than 600 years earlier ..

"Nabta, Egypt","Stone Circle, Menhirs",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/egyptnabta.htm,"Nabta Playa, Egypt","The stone circle at Nabta is special in several ways. Firstly, it   is the only megalithic circle in Egypt, but perhaps more importantly,   it was situated on the Tropic of Cancer (presumably deliberately),   which makes it one of the first known examples of an astronomicobservatoryin the world. Located 100 km west of Abu Simbel, in southernmost Egypt, Nabta Playa is a large, internally drained basin, which during the early Holocene ( ca. 11,000 - 5500 calibrated radiocarbon years ago) was a large and important ceremonial centre for prehistoric people. It was intermittently and seasonally filled with water, which encouraged people to come there, and today it contains dozens, and perhaps hundreds, of archaeological sites. People came from many regions to Nabta Playa to record astronomical events, erect alignments of megaliths, and build impressive stone structures.(1) In March 1998, a team led by Southern University Methodist Anthropology Prof. Fred Wendorf announced that they had found the megalithic site. The site consists of a stone circle, a series of flat, stone structures and five lines of standing and toppled megaliths. Romauld Schild of the Polish Academy of Sciences confirmed that one of the megalithic lines was orientated in an east-west direction. The Nabta Playa basin has been occupied by humans since around the 10th Millenium BC(1), There is evidence of cattle domestication, perhaps offering the first suggestions of the later cattle veneration seen in the early Egyptian dynasties.    Alignments- Five megalithic alignments at Nabta radiate outwards from a central collection of megalithic structures. The small stone circle contains four sets of upright slabs, two of the sets being aligned in a north-south direction while the second pair of slabs provides a line of sight towards the summer solstice horizon. An east-west alignment is also present between one megalithic structure and two stone megaliths, which stand about a mile distant. Furthermore there are two other geometric lines involving about a dozen additional stone monuments that lead both north-east and south-east from the same megalith.(16).   Article- Science Daily   1998 An assembly of huge stone   slabs found in Egypt's Sahara Desert that date from about 6,500 years to 6,000   years ago has been confirmed by scientists to be the oldest known astronomical   alignment of megaliths in the world. Known as Nabta, the site   consists of a stone circle, a series of flat, tomb-like stone structures and   five lines of standing and toppled megaliths. Located west of the Nile River   in southern Egypt, Nabta predates Stonehenge and similar prehistoric sites   around the world by about 1,000 years, said University of Colorado at Boulder   astronomy Professor J. McKim Malville. The Nabta site was   discovered several years ago by a team led by Southern Methodist University   anthropology Professor Fred Wendorf. A 1997 GPS satellite survey by Malville,   Wendorf, Ali A Mazar of the Egyptian Geological Survey and Romauld Schild of   the Polish Academy of Sciences confirmed one of the megalith lines was   oriented in an east-west direction. ""This is the oldest   documented astronomical alignment of megaliths in the world,"" said Malville.   ""A lot of effort went into the construction of a purely symbolic and   ceremonial site."" The stone slabs, some of which are nine feet high, were   dragged to the site from a mile or more distant, he said. The ruins lie on the   shoreline of an ancient lake that began filling with water about 11,000 years   ago when the African summer monsoon shifted north. It was used by nomads until   about 4,800 years ago, when the monsoon moved southwest and the area again   became ""hyperarid and uninhabitable."" Five megalithic alignments   at Nabta radiate outward from a central collection of megalithic structures.   Beneath one structure was a sculptured rock resembling a cow standing upright,   Malville said. The team also excavated several cattle burials at Nabta,   including an articulated skeleton buried in a roofed, clay-lined chamber. Neolithic herders that began   coming to Nabta about 10,000 years ago -- probably from central Africa -- used   cattle in their rituals just as the African Massai do today, he said. No human   remains have yet been found at Nabta. The 12-foot-in-diameter   stone circle contains four sets of upright slabs. Two sets were aligned in a   north-south direction while the second pair of slabs provides a line of sight   toward the summer solstice horizon. Because of Nabta's proximity   to the Tropic of Cancer, the noon sun is at its zenith about three weeks   before and three weeks after the summer solstice, preventing upright objects   from casting shadows. ""These vertical sighting stones in the circle correspond   to the zenith sun during the summer solstice,"" said Malville, an   archaeoastronomer. ""For many cultures in the tropics, the zenith sun has been a   major event for millennia."" An east-west alignment also   is present between one megalithic structure and two stone megaliths about a   mile distant. There also are two other geometric lines involving about a dozen   additional stone monuments that lead both north-east and south-east from the   same megalith. ""We still don't understand the significance of these lines,"" Malville said. During summer and fall, the   individual stone monoliths would have been partially submerged in the lake and   may have been ritual markers for the onset of the rainy season. ""The   organization of these objects suggest a symbolic geometry that integrated   death, water and the sun,"" Malville said. Although some believe the   ""high culture"" of subsequent Egyptian dynasties was borrowed from Mesopotamia   and Syria, Malville and others believe the complex and symbolic Nabta culture   may have stimulated the growth of the society that eventually constructed the   first pyramids along the Nile about 4,500 years ago. ""The Nabta culture may have   been a trigger for the development of social complexity in Egypt that later   led to the Pharaonic dynasty,"" he said. The Nabta project was funded primarily   by the National Science Foundation. The site also contains a   wealth of cultural debris, including small, fire-blackened stones from ancient   hearths built along the ancient lakeshore as well as manos, metates and carved   and decorated ostrich eggshells.

Located west of the Nile River   in southern Egypt, Nabta predates Stonehenge and similar prehistoric sites   around the world by about 1,000 years, said University of Colorado at Boulder   astronomy Professor J.
The Nabta site was   discovered several years ago by a team led by Southern Methodist University   anthropology Professor Fred Wendorf.
A 1997 GPS satellite survey by Malville,   Wendorf, Ali A Mazar of the Egyptian Geological Survey and Romauld Schild of   the Polish Academy of Sciences confirmed one of the megalith lines was   oriented in an east-west direction.
Two sets were aligned in a   north-south direction while the second pair of slabs provides a line of sight   toward the summer solstice horizon.
""These vertical sighting stones in the circle correspond   to the zenith sun during the summer solstice,"" said Malville, an   archaeoastronomer.
""For many cultures in the tropics, the zenith sun has been a   major event for millennia."" An east-west alignment also   is present between one megalithic structure and two stone megaliths about a   mile distant.",Egypt,Africa
"Nan Modal, Pacific",Island Citadel,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/nanmodal.htm,"Nan Modal, Pohnpei"," Excavations designed to reveal architectural building stages and style changes verify more than 2000 years of occupation and possibly a 1000 year span of major construction activity from A.D. 500 to 1500. Nan Madol was the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty, which united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people. Set apart on the main island of Pohnpei, it was a scene of human activity as early as the first or second century AD. By the 8th or 9th century islet construction had started, but the distinctive megalithic architecture was probably not begun until perhaps the 12th or early 13th century. The highly stratified social system at Nan Madol is the earliest known example of such centralized political power in the western Pacific. Within the city, social hierarchy was reflected in the size of the residences built within the compounds, the largest being the homes of the chiefly elite. Excavations of these elite residences have revealed the presence of beads and other ornaments, which may have marked their owner's social status. Pohnpeian tradition claims that the builders of the Lelu complex on Kosrae (likewise composed of huge stone buildings) migrated to Pohnpei, where they used their skills and experience to build the even more impressive Nan Madol complex. However, this is unlikely because radiocarbon dates have placed the construction of Nan madol prior to that of Lelu. Like Lelu, one major purpose of constructing a separate city was to insulate the nobility from the common people. A local story holds that when Nan Madol was being built a powerful magician living in the well inhabited region on the northwest of the island was solicited, and that his help was a major factor in completing the building. In particular, he was responsible for supplying the huge stone ""logs"" used in much of Nan Madol by ""flying"" them from their source to the construction site. An intriguing aspect of Nan Madol is the close correlation between the oral history of the site and evidence unearthed during archaeological excavations. For example, oral traditions make references to small canals cut into the islets, allowing sacred eels to enter from the sea so that they could be honoured through the sacrifice of captured sea turtles. Subsequent excavations have revealed traces of both the small canals and the sacrificial turtles. Native Taiwanese populations carry the purest form of Asian specific Human Lymphocyte Antigens(A24-Cw8-B48, A24-Cw9-B61 and A24-Cw10-B60). Studies have showed that the Taiwan area was the centre of dispersal for the; Tibetans, Thais, Tlingit, Kwakuitl, Haida, Hawaiian, Maori, Pima, Maya, Yakut, Inuit, Buryat, Man, Japanese from Shizuoka and Orochon from North East China. 'The ancestors of the Hawaiian race came not from the islands the South Pacific ï¿½ for the immigrants from that direction were late arrivals there. ï¿½ but from the northern direction (welau lani), that is, from the land of Kalonakikeke, now known as Alaska. According to this tradition, a great flood that occurred during the reign of Kahiko-Luamea on the continent of Ka-Houpo-o-Kane, (Ta'pen Keng is the ancient name for Taiwan) and carried away a floating log of wood named Konikonihia.

"Nazca, Peru",Desert Drawings,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/perunazca.htm,"Nazca, Peru","The Nazca valley is a strip of level   desert ground 37 miles long and a mile wide. The enormous drawings were   made by removing the dark purple granite pebbles which cover the floor,   and exposing the light yellow sand beneath. The drawings were first   confirmed when commercial airlines began flights over the Andes. There are essentially two kinds of drawings at Nazca; Those that are Zoomorphic  in nature (above), and the larger geometric ones, some of which run into the surrounding hills. The purpose of these designs is still unknown, although astronomy and a form of ritual worship is suspected. The first detailed study of the drawings was initiated by the German astronomer and archaeologist Dr. Maria Reiche. She discovered that the lines, some of which run for up to five miles, have an average error of no more than 9 minutes of arc, a deviation of only 4.5 yards per mile. The same figure that is the limit of accuracy which can be obtained by modern photogram-metric survey techniques. One drawing represents a thin-limbed monkey, recently identified as the Spider Monkey from the Amazon jungle, while a remnant of Nazca pottery has a distinct picture of a Penguin indigenous to either Antarctica or possibly the Galapagos islands. Another piece of pottery found has the faces of five girls on it ï¿½ one white, one red, one black, one brown and one yellow(9).  In 1983   Italian archaeologist Giuseppe Orefici began a long-term project   to investigate the Nasca. Every year he brings a team of   specialists to South America for 3 intensive months of excavation.   Orefici has concentrated on one remarkable Nasca site, an ancient   city called Cahuachi. He is convinced that this mysterious place   is the key to understanding the line builders. The   Cahuachi site is huge, extending across 370 acres. The most   impressive monument is this 30 metre high pyramid which dominated   the ancient city. It was built by modifying a natural high point   in the land. As well as the pyramid, there were 40 other   structures, each sculpted from the landscape itself and enhanced   by massive mud brick adobe walls. Extensive plazas and terraces   once covered the land here, nearly 2,000 years ago. Cahuachi lies   75 kilometres inland from the coast of Peru. The archaeologists eventually unearthed 63   pieces of Nasca fabric, but there is a puzzle.The fabrics come   from different periods of Nasca history and yet they were all   jumbled up together.Many parts are badly decomposed due to   the presence of organic matter and due to exposure to humidity.   These pieces of cloth were laid in a tomb in Cahuachi. They have a   special significance not only as example of textile art but   because the cloth has been sacrificed. It was placed with its   needles and needle cases in this large tomb. The sacrifice of the   fabrics provided important evidence about the kind of place   Cahuachi was in ancient times. The textiles are richly decorated   with images from Nasca mythology and don't appear to be intended   for everyday use. It looks as if the people of Cahuachi were   rather special, a Nasca elite. If the average Nasca citizen wasn't   wearing these fabrics, who was? All the evidence from Orefici's   huge collection of textiles points to one conclusion: the people   of Cahuachi weren't soldiers or citizens,they were priests. 2,000 years ago it would seem like an oasis. We   have the river valley with fields, we have very strong, healthy   people, plenty of food to eat, no warfare. They were fairly short,   long black hair, probably muscular from working very hard and we   have evidence from the skeletal materials, particularly the teeth,   that they were very healthy people and also from those same   skeletons we see no evidence of trauma. There was no warfare here. Recent investigation has linked the lines   directly with water. Although the animal images are the best   known, there are also the 800 straight lines which run for many   kilometres across the pampa. It's been shown that all but one of   these lines start from star-like radial points often marked by a   low mound and every one of those points bordered rivers and   tributaries so if the lines were used for ceremonial walking, as   seems very likely, some Nasca ceremonies were devoted to the   precious sources of water.Water is also intimately connected with   Cahuachi. For much of its length the Nazca river runs underground.   Where it re-emerges the Nasca built their ceremonial capital. After 17 years of excavation Giuseppe Orefici   has been able to use the hard archaeological evidence to   reconstruct the world of Cahuachi. Moulded from the desert itself   the pyramids and plazas of the lost Nazca city were the site of   ceremony and ritual. It was a city of priests who were guardians   of Nasca culture and religion. The only reliable sources of water for the people   of the Nazca valley are the high mountains of the Andes. The rivers   flow from their mountain sources for only two brief seasons. At some   point in the past the Nasca built an impressive irrigation system to   control the precious water. 150 kilometres of aqueducts, most of them   underground, criss-crossed the region. The ancient Nasca system is   still in use today. This is a puquio. It gives access to deep,   subterranean tunnels which can become blocked with debris.  A new giant picture on the     Nazca Plateau in Peru, which is famous for giant patterns that     can be seen from the air, has been discovered by a team of     Japanese researchers. The image is 65 meters long,     and appears to be an animal with horns. It is thought to have     been drawn as a symbol of hopes for good crops, but there are no     similar patterns elsewhere, and the type of the animal remains     unclear. The discovery marks the first   time since the 1980s that a picture other than a geometrical   pattern has been found on the Nazca Plateau. The picture was found   by a team of researchers including Masato Sakai, an associate   professor at Yamagata University, after they analyzed images from   a U.S. commercial satellite. They confirmed it was a   previously undiscovered picture in a local survey in March this   year. It is located south of the Nazca Plateau, and apparently   went undiscovered since few tourist planes pass over the area. Two parts of the picture, that   appear to be horns, bear close resemblance to those that appear on   earthenware dating from 100 B.C. to A.D. 600, during the time when   the Nazca kingdom flourished, and it is thought that they relate   to fertility rites. The research team will use   images from the advanced land-observing satellite ""Daichi,"" which   was launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency in January   this year, to create a distribution map of images on the earth   that can be seen from the air. There is evidence that vehicles had   driven in the area, and part of the picture is destroyed. ""We want   to identify all the images, and work to preserve earth pictures   that are gradually being destroyed,"" Sakai said. A group of about 50 drawings of   giant figures recently discovered in the hills of Peruï¿½s southern   coastal desert near the city of Palpa has been said to predate the   famous Nazca lines nearby. Mr. Johny Isla, director of the   Andean Institute of Archaeological Studies, said the ï¿½geoglyphï¿½   figures appear to have been created by the Paracas communities   between 500 and 400BC, whereas the Nazca culture developed after   50 BC. Mr. Isla and his partner Dr. Markus Reindel from the Dutch   Institute of Archaeology discovered the Paracas figures using   aerial photography and land-based surveys. The figures of humans,   birds, monkeys and cats vary in size from 10m to 50m across, and   are also grouped together in areas up to 60 m to 90 m across. Most of these   geoglyphs belong to the Nazca culture but our recent studies   demonstrated that there are at least 50 geoglyphs pertaining to   the Paracas culture. These new figures are definitely different   and older than those of the Nazca culture. ï¿½First, the Paracas   figures were drawn on the slopes of the hills, while the Nazca   images were drawn in level areas. Second, the Paracas figures are   smaller and were made in a naturalistic style, while the Nazca   figures are bigger and stylised. Third, the Paracas figures are   mostly arranged in groups, while the Nazca figures are arranged   individually. Finally, it is important to note that not one of the   Paracas figures were repeated in the Nazca iconography,ï¿½ </body> In the midst of the study area is a unique labyrinth originally discovered by Prof Ruggles when he spent a few days on the Nazca desert back in 1984. ï¿½When I set out along the labyrinth from its centre, I didnï¿½t have the slightest idea of its true nature,ï¿½ Prof Ruggles explained. ï¿½Only gradually did I realize that here was a figure set out on a huge scale and still traceable, that it was clearly intended for walking. Invisible in its entirety to the naked eye, the only way of knowing its existence is to walk its 2.7 miles (4.4 km) length through disorienting direction changes which ended, or began, inside a spiral formation. ï¿½The labyrinth is completely hidden in the landscape, which is flat and virtually featureless. As you walk it, only the path stretching ahead of you is visible at any given point. Similarly, if you map it from the air its form makes no sense at all.ï¿½ ï¿½But if you walk it, discovering it as you go, you have a set of experiences that in many respects would have been the same for anyone walking it in the past. The ancient Nazca peoples created the geoglyphs, and used them, by walking on the ground. Sharing some of those experiences by walking the lines ourselves is an important source of information that complements the hard scientific and archaeological evidence and can really aid our attempts to make anthropological sense of it.ï¿½ ","(-14.8358687, -74.9327583)",-14.8358687,-74.9327583,"There are essentially two kinds of drawings at Nazca; Those that are Zoomorphic  in nature (above), and the larger geometric ones, some of which run into the surrounding hills.

"Nevali Cori, Turkey",Cult Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/turkeynevali.htm,"Nevali Cori, Turkey","The site was examined in 1993   during the erection of the Attaturk Dam. Excavations were conducted by   a team from the University of Heidelberg under the direction of   Professor Harald Hauptmann. Together with numerous other   archaeological sites in the vicinity, Nevali Cori has since been   inundated by the dammed waters of the Euphrates. The site of one of the oldest carved monoliths in the world. The temples were lost when the Ataturk dam was established and flooded the area. The central cult building has been carbon dated to 8,000 BC, and consisted of a temple built with 13 stone uprights in the walls, and with an enormous monolith in the centre (once a pair). The design of the temple has been compared to the Kalasaya atTiahuanaco, Bolivia, while the hands on the monolith are reminiscent of those on theEaster islandstatues. Of the 22 buildings uncovered at Nevali Cori, only one appears to have been used as a dwelling. The presence of decorated skulls inside the shrines, as at several other Neolithic sites in the middle east (ï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½,ï¿½atal Huyuketc), suggests that the site was used for the practice of a common ritual. The evidence emerging from this site strongly suggests the 'the sculpted figures and carvings depictshamanicindividuals adorned in coats and head-dresses of vulture feathers'.(1)  Chronology:According to carbon dating, the earliest occupation of the site began at about 8,400 BC. The settlement was continuously in use until the middle of the sixth millennium BC.(1)    In terms of   absolute dates, 4 radiocarbon dates have been determined for Nevalı   ï¿½ori. Three are from Stratum II and date it with some certainty to the   second half of the 9th millennium BC, which coincides with early dates   fromï¿½ayï¿½nï¿½and with Mureybet IVA and   thus supports the relative chronology above. The fourth dates to the   10th millennium.  The local limestone was carved   into numerous statues and smaller sculptures, including a more than   life-sized bare human head with a snake or sikha-like tuft. Some of   the pillars also bore relief's, including ones of human hands. The   free-standing anthropomorphic figures of limestone excavated at Nevali   Cori belong to the earliest known life-size sculptures. Comparable   material has been found atGï¿½bekli Tepe(Currently considered to be the oldest temple in the world at c. 9,500   BC). Several hundred small clay   figurines (about 5 cm high), most of them depicting humans, have been   interpreted as votive offerings. They were fired at temperatures   between 500-600ï¿½C, which suggests the development of ceramic firing   technology before the advent of pottery proper. This particular sculpture (right) is claimed to be the head of an Indian Vedic priest by B. G. Sidhartha, who whilst researching the early (similar) date of the Rig Veda, came across it in the archaeological literature. He said of it: -The corners of the main 'cult' building are aligned cardinally, leaving the temple facing almost exactly SW.

"Ness of Brodgar, Scotland   (Ceremonial complex)",Ceremonial complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/scotlandness.htm,The Ness of Brodgar," The 'Ness' of Brodgar: The Ness of Brodgar has been revealed as an integral part of the Brodgar/Stennes Complex, being sited directly between the two sites, and composing a complex of around 100 buildings and a vast wall, 100m long and 4m wide, traversing the width of the peninsula and potentially surrounding the site turning it into the equivalent of a a temple precinct.(2)This site has greatly helped to unravel the prehistoric perspective of the area. The site It was occupied from 3,500 BC for over a thousand years, showing stark similarities with Stonehenge. The archaeologist, Mike Pearson who conducted the recent digs at Stonehenge has suggested that the two sites may have similarities in function, representing the symbolic boundary between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Structure 1:This building has three doorways and three hearths. One of the doorways appears to require its user to step over a hearth. Structure 8:A long building with a doorway at one end and three hearths along the middle. Inside, the side walls are divided into compartments by larger piers built into the walls. The building contained several broken mace heads and some whale bone. Structure 12:Curiously, this buildinghas no hearths, the same piers, and a narrow entrance at one end. Structure 10: ('The Cathedral')This building was built over other buildings within the walls and is therefore considerably younger. Itï¿½s roughly square, has immensely thick walls enclosing a small central room and is surrounded by a large amount of cattle bone.  The wall is suggested to have surrounded the complex almost entirely. It is the result of a fantastic amount of man-hours, being 4m wide along its length. It acts as a view-obscuring barrier with the most beautiful stonework incorporated into the side facing the Ring itself. It is believed that it was not intended as a defensive structure, but was more of a symbolic barrier, separating the activity on the south-east of the Ness from whatever activity was going on around theRing of Brodgar. The wallï¿½s discovery fits in with a theory proposed a few years ago that the two stone rings had specific roles inNeolithic life ï¿½ in particular representing life and death. This was first proposed by archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson in a paper presented at theNeolithic Conference in Kirkwall in 1998. Based on his earlier work on Stonehenge and Avebury, in England, he suggested that theStanding Stones of Stenness, with its central hearth and surrounded by evidence of feasting, settlement and activity, represented life and the world of the living. In stark contrast, the Brodgar ring, with its marked lack of domestic activity and later surrounded by a complex ofBronze Ageburial barrows, represented death, or a spiritual domain of the ancestors. So if this theory is correct, was the procession fromStenness to Brodgar seen as a symbolic journey from life to death?  Experts have uncovered what is being called a Neolithic 'Cathedral'. The massive building is of a kind never seen before in Britain. It is 82 ft long and 65ft wide with walls still standing over 3ft high (proposed at 10ft originally), which were up to 16ft thick and surround a cross-shaped inner sanctum. The building was surrounded by a paved outer passage, which experts believe may have formed a labyrinth that would have led people to the heart of the building.(1) Two stone slabs bearing red, yellow and orange pigment are the first evidence of painted walls ever found in the UK. The paint will be subjected to laboratory analysis to determine its composition. It is probably based upon hematite or limonite, two iron ores found in the region. These would have been finely ground and mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs to create pigments.Since this is the first finding of its kind, it is not known if walls were commonly painted or if this was reserved for ceremonial structures such as the ï¿½cathedralï¿½ at Ness of Brodgar where the discovery was made. There is speculation that decorative markings carved into the sandstone of the interior walls may also have been enhanced with colour.(4) ","(58.99701929999999, -3.2147998)",58.99701929999999,-3.2147998,"The 'Ness' of Brodgar: The Ness of Brodgar has been revealed as an integral part of the Brodgar/Stennes Complex, being sited directly between the two sites, and composing a complex of around 100 buildings and a vast wall, 100m long and 4m wide, traversing the width of the peninsula and potentially surrounding the site turning it into the equivalent of a a temple precinct.(2)This site has greatly helped to unravel the prehistoric perspective of the area.

"Newgrange, Ireland   (Passage Mounds)",Passage Mounds,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/irelandnewgrange.htm,"Newgrange, Ireland","The Newgrange passage-mound sits at the heart of the Boyne valley complex. The structure is composed of 280,000 tons of river rolled stones, and the white granite that makes up the exterior face was transported especially from the coast, 50 miles away. Surrounded by a stone circle (12 remaining from an estimated original 36), with 97 Kerb-stones, an internal cruciform chamber and  corbelled roof, the grandiose scale of the earth-works at Newgrange make it one of the most spectacular of prehistoric monuments in all Europe. The recognition that it provides an accurate means of measuring the solar year (to within a margin of several minutes), is testimony to the prehistoric mind. According to Irish mythology Newgrange was one of the sidhe, or fairy-mounds, where the Tuatha De Danann lived. It was built by the god Dagda, but his son Oengus later tricked him out of it. It is named for the goddess Boann, the mother of Aengus, who is also credited with the creation of the River Boyne. Newgrange has been radio-carbon dated to around 3,200 BC (2)   The current shape of the mound - The mound is not a perfect circle, but is made up of a series of sections of parabolas, supporting Prof. A. Thom's assertion of geometry in the design.Around the mound are 12 standing stones which are believed to have been set up the same time. The kerb-stone that lies before the passage has carvings similar to one found on theOrkneys, and another found atBugibba, Malta.   The Entrance:  The Light-box/Roof-box-Above the entrance passage is a 'light-box', which precisely aligns with the rising sun at the winter solstice of 21st  December, so that the rays touch the ground at the very centre of the tomb for about 20 minutes. Many of the upright stones along the walls of the 19m (62ft) passage, which follows the rise of the hill, are richly decorated.  The light-box combines with other design features so that the light is narrowed with the result that a small 'dagger' of light slides along the floor of the passage towards the inner chamber, where it illuminates it for 17 minutes a year.  There are suggestions of roof-boxes at other UK sites. There is another atCarrowkeelin Ireland, and similar light effects are recorded atBryn-celli-Dduin Wales Similar carvings as those found on the front face of the lintel of the roof box can be seen at other  passage mounds, such as at The stone at Newgrange appears to have eight crosses on its face, but a diagram of the stone before reconstruction (below), suggests that there may have once been another cross on the face, which would make a total of nine crosses, the same as at Gavr'inis..    The passage slopes upwards towards the centre of the tomb so that the floor-level inside the chamber is at the same height as the ceiling level at the entrance, the passage also undulates from side to side along its length. The combined effect of these two features is that the light that enters the passage is narrowed both vertically and horizontally into a small focused beam of light that only penetrates the internal chamber for a few minutes on the winter solstice. The stones that cover the passage had small channels cut into them on their upper-faces to keep the passage dry. Similarly, the stones that compose the corbelled roof of the chamber are all sloped downwards on the outside, also presumable to keep the chamber dry. These features highlight the skill of the builders, and lend weight to the idea that the structure was built for long-term use (rather than as a funerary structure).   Inside the heart of the mound is a single corbelled chamber entered through the passage orientated towards the sunrise on the winter solstice. The internal plan is in the form of a cross (cruciform), and is lined with large slabs of rock.The cruciform chamber inside the mound measures 6.5 x 6.2m (21ft 6in x 17ft), has three recesses, and is topped by a magnificent corbelled roof reaching to a height of 6m (20ft) above the floor. In the recesses are three massive stone basins (similar to those found in the temples on Malta), and which presumably served some ritual use.The basin in the back alcove was broken a few hundred years ago by a treasure hunter.(16).Excavations in the central chamber produced the remains of two burials and at least three cremated bodies as well as seven marbles, four pendants, two beads, a flint flake, a bone chisel, and fragments of several bone pins and points.  Cruciform passage graves   describe a complex example of prehistoric passage mound found inIreland,Walesand theOrkneysand built during the later Neolithic, 'from around 3,500 BC and later' The cruciform shape of the interior chambers is a common prehistoric design feature, seen in several prehistoric structures from different European sites in Scotland, France and Malta. It is interesting that in several of these locations, large round 'offering bowls' have been found. (Such asMaes Howe, Orkneys and theTarxien, Malta). They are distinguished by a long   passage leading to a central chamber with a corbelled roof. From this,   burial chambers extend in three directions, giving the overall   impression in plan of a cross shape layout. Some examples have further   sub-chambers leading off the three original chambers. The network of   chambers is covered by a cairn and lined outside with kerb-stones.  Chronology-Newgrange has been radio-carbon dated to around 3,200 BC: It gets its modern name from the fact that by 1142, the site had become part of Mellifont Abbey farm. These farms were known as granges, and by 14th century the site was known only as the 'New Grange'. In early Irish mythology, Newgrange was not only the alleged burial place of the prehistoric kings ofTara, but also the home of a race of Irish supernatural beings, known as 'Tuatha de Danann' : the people of the goddess Danu. Newgrange was also taken to be the house of the patriarchal god Dagda.  Archaeo-astronomy- The most noticeable astronomical feature of Newgrange is the orientation of the passage towards the winter solstice sunrise. Although, in itself this no mean feat of engineering. What is amazing is that the designers managed to narrow the beam of solstice sunlight into such a small beam of light, and then have it travelling upward along the channel towards the chamber. In addition, the light-box itself has been designed so as to enhance this effect. Newgrange is just one part of a huge observatory that is the 'Boyne valley complex'. Examples of spiral-'art' at Newgrange - Information has emerged in favour of the suggestion that they have an astronomical meaning. An American artist has apparently shown though experiment, how the suns rays, when projected onto an object and recorded at the same time each day over a full year, create the shape of a double-spiral(What then is the meaning of the triple spiral?).

"Nippur, Iran",City State,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/iraqnippur.htm,"Nippur, Sumeria","During its peak, at around 2500 B.C, Nippur boasted   multiple large temples, government buildings and businesses. Its   inhabitants were very literate for the time - over 40,000 inscribed clay   Sumerian and Akkadian tablets have been found there, bearing all from epic   tales such as the Creation Story to legal documents, medical records and   school texts. Powerful trading connections have been revealed in the range   of objects originating from such other civilizations as Babylonia, Egypt,   Persia, the Indus Valley, and Greece. The ruins of Nippur, among the largest in southern Mesopotamia, cover approximately 180 acres. They are divided into two well-nigh equal parts by the now dry bed of the Shatt-en-Nil, a canal which at one time branched off from the Euphrates and watered the otherwise barren territory through which it flowed. The eastern half contains the temple structures, including the ziggurat and the group of buildings which must have formed the scribal school and library; it is in this part of the mound that the ""tablet house"" was excavated. The western half seems to mark the remains of the city proper. Nippur was situated on both sides of the Shatt-en-Nil canal, one of the earliest courses of the Euphrates, between the present bed of that river and the Tigris, almost 160 km southeast of Baghdad. It is represented by the great complex of ruin mounds known to the Arabs asNuffar, written by the earlier explorersNiffer, divided into two main parts by the dry bed of the old Shatt-en-Nil (Arakhat). The highest point of these ruins, a conical hill rising about 30 m above the level of the surrounding plain, northeast of the canal bed, is called by the ArabsBint el-Amiror""prince's daughter."" The contents of these tablets are rich and varied. The greater part is economic in character; it consists of contracts and bills of sale, promissory notes and receipts, lists and accounts, wills, adoptions, court decisions, and other legal and administrative documents. Many of the tablets are letters; some are historical inscriptions; still others are lexical in character, that is, they contain Sumerian dictionary and grammatical material of priceless value for our study of the language, since they were actually compiled by the ancient scribes themselves. But especially noteworthy is the large group of tablets dated about 1750 B. C.awhich are inscribed with the Sumerian literary compositions consisting of epics and myths, hymns and laments, proverbs and ""wisdom."" But of the Nippur literary tablets excavated by the University of Pennsylvania and now located in Istanbul and Philadelphia, sometwo thousandin number, only aboutfive hundredhave been copied and published to date. And while all of the approximately seven hundred pieces in the British Museum, Louvre, Berlin Museum, and Ashmolean Museum have been copied and published,12some of the more important texts did not appear until a relatively recent date. THIS clay tablet from ancient Nippur   is the only surviving document of the Sumerian flood story. Dating   from the 17th century BC, the tablet contains six columns of text,   three per side, with 10-15 lines in each column. Written in Sumerian,   it not only tells the flood story, but also describes the creation of   humans and animals, and records the names of antediluvian cities and   their rulers. The Sumerians formulated lists of their ancient kings, and gave them extremely long reigns. The time before the flood was said to be a period of 432,000 years. Two kings from after the flood that are listed were Gilgamesh and Tammuz. Legends told about these two kings were so impressive that Tammuz entered the pantheon of Babylon and later became known as Adonis to the Greeks. Gilgamesh became the hero of the Babylonian epic poem which bears his name, and which also contains an account of the flood. Until recently, these king lists and the names in them were thought to be purely fanciful. But in the 1930's, Sir Leonard Woolley, while excavating a building at Ur on the Ubaid level, found an inscription indicating that the structure had been erected by the son of the founder of the First Dynasty of Ur, a person up till that time regarded as fiction. Gilgamesh, too, has been found to be a real person, with inscriptions telling of the buildings he built.  Ur-Gur also rebuilt the walls of the city in general on the line of Naram-Sin's walls. The restoration of the general features of the temple of this and the immediately succeeding periods has been greatly facilitated by the discovery of a sketch map on a fragment of a clay tablet. This sketch map represents a quarter of the city to the eastward of the Shatt-en-Nil canal, which was enclosed within its own walls, a city within a city, forming an irregular square, with sides roughly 820 m long, separated from the other quarters of the city, as from the surrounding country to the northand east, by canals on all sides, with broad quays along the walls. A smaller canal divided this quarter of the city itself into twoparts, in the south-eastern part of which, in the middle of its southeast side, stood the temple, while in the northwest part, along the Shatt-en-Nil, two great storehouses are indicated. The temple proper, according to this plan, consisted of an outer and innercourt, each covering approximately 8 acres (32,000 mï¿½), surrounded by double walls, with ziggurat on the north-western edge of the latter.  Sargon of Akkad may   have been the world's first empire-builder. Legend states that he was   found floating in a basket and brought up by a gardener. Later it is   known he became a cupbearer to King Ur-Zazaba of Kish in Sumer. Sargon   rose from obscurity to overthrow Lugalzaggisi of Uruk, famously   forcing the defeated ruler into a yoke and leading him to the gate of   Enlil, at Nippur. Sargon then established what became known as the   first empire in human history, becoming the king of Akkad Ur-Gur gave to the temple its final characteristic form. Partly razing the constructions of his predecessors, he erected a terrace of bricks, some 12 m high, covering a space of about 32,000 mï¿½, near the north-western edge of which, towards the western corner, he built a ziggurat, or stage-tower, of three stages of dry brick, faced with kiln-fired bricks laid in bitumen. On the summit of this artificial mountain stood, apparently, as at Ur and Eridu, a small chamber, the special shrine or abode of the god. Access to the stages of the ziggurat, from the court beneath, was had by an inclined plane on the south-east side. To the north-east of the ziggurat stood, apparently, the House of Bel, and in the courts below the ziggurat stood various other buildings, shrines, treasure chambers and the like. The whole structure was roughly oriented, with the corners towards the cardinal points of the compass.    A devotional statue dating to 2600 B.C. of what scholars believe is a married couple. The gypsum statue was  found buried beneath the floor of a shine at Nippur in Iraq and measures 3.5 inches wide at the bottom. The couple originally had feet, and the figures have eyes made of shell and lapis lazuli set in bitumen. Knee and T-joints made about 4,000 B.C. Found in the excavation of the Temple of Bel at Nippur, Babylonia. Pipe was made of baked clay. Babylonia is often referred to as the birthplace of pipe.

"Old Sarum, England (Neolithic Hill Fort)",Neolithic Hill Fort,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandoldsarum.htm,"Old Sarum, England","This spectacular hill-fort was once one of the most important places in England. It's importance is highlighted by the fact that it was variously occupied by the Romans, Saxons and  Normans. Old Sarum lies on one of the earliest recognised examples of leylines as determined by Sir N. Lockyer. It is connected to both Salisbury and Stonehenge, both sacred places on the Wiltshire landscape.  Although not much is known of the earliest years of this important structure, archaeological remains of rough stone tools suggest people have occupied the hilltop area of Old Sarum sinceNeolithic times (around 3000 BC).(1)The banks of the structure were begun almost 5000 years ago, and remained intact until the Roman invasion. At this time it was calledSorviodunum. Following the departure of the Romans, the Saxons are known to have used the site, arriving in 552 BC, they called the siteSearobyrgbut when the Normans came they realised its strategic importance and constructed a motte and bailey castle within the old earthworks. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, William the Conqueror used Old Sarum as a base of operations. William moved the bishopric from the Anglo-Saxon Sherborne Cathedral to Old Sarum, appointing his nephew, Osmund de Sees, as his chancellor and Bishop of Salisbury. Osmund had the first cathedral at Old Sarum built, completed in 1092  A contemporary observer, Peter of Blois (c.1135 ï¿½ 1203) described Old Sarum as ï¿½barren, dry, and solitary, exposed to the rage of the wind; and the church (stands) as a captive on the hill where it was built, like the ark of God shut up in the profane house of Baal.ï¿½ In 1219 Bishop Richard Poore decided to build a new cathedral at a location several miles to the south. Stone from the old cathedral was used to build the new one. A settlement grew up around the site of the new cathedral, and it is this settlement that is the modern city of Salisbury. With the shift of settlement away from Old Sarum to New Sarum (Salisbury) the old site lapsed and the castle fell into disuse. Despite the fact that the site was derelict, Old Sarum continued to send a representative to Parliament until the mid 19th century. According to legend, the bishop d'Avranches decreed that an arrow would be fired from the walls of the keep, and the new cathedral would be built wherever it fell. Miraculously, however, the arrow struck a passing deer, who fled a full two miles to the banks of the Avon  This is another classic alignment originating with Sir Norman Lockyer. It runs for 181/2 miles NNW-SSE passing through Stonehenge. The line starts N of Stonehenge at a tumulus (12004409) on Durrington Down, proceeds towards Stonehenge, which is just visible from the barrow, and crosses the Cursus on its way. It misses the sarsen circle at Stonehenge, but crosses ley SW7 on the edge of the earthwork just where the Avenue connects to it. The ley continues SSE to Old Sarum (13823272) an impressive earthwork enclosure with extremely deep ditches. This is yet another example of an evolved site, having been an Iron Age hill-fort, then a Roman town which in turn was superseded by pagan Saxon occupation until finally, in medieval times, a hill town with a keep and a cathedral occupied the site. Legend has it that Bishop Poore had a vision of the Blesses Virgin, who told him to build at a certain place. He didn't know where this was to be until informed by local people. So Salisbury Cathedral (14312954) came to be founded on its present site. The ley passes marginally to the E of the outstanding 404 foot spire which, according to the late Guy Underwood, marks an exceptionally powerful blind spring. The spire also seems to attract the mysterious White Birds of Salisbury Plain - large albatross-like birds, dazzlingly white, which are said to appear whenever a bishop of Salisbury is dying. They were certainly seen in 1911, accurately foretelling the death of the then bishop. When the cathedral was transferred from Old Sarum, the body of St. Osmund was brought down and placed in a shrine within the new building. There is also a tomb in the cathedral containing the body of the murderer Lord Stourton, who was hanged with a silken noose. For a long time a wire noose hung over the tomb but was removed in 1780. However, its luminous outline could still be seen, even 'within living memory by unimpeachable witnesses'. Crossing Salisbury, the line goes through a crossroads near Odstock and on to Clearbury Ring (15132443), where it passes through the NW corner of the earthworks. This Iron Age camp is wooded and can be seen for great distances as a clump, but the earthworks themselves are not particularly impressive visually. Michell has observed that the line from Stonehenge to Clearbury is 19,800 (660x30) yards in length, exactly 30 times the length of twin geomantic circles he discovered over Glastonbury. The fact that this ley is virtually at the same angle as the Glastonbury ley reinforces this correspondence.

"Orca dolmens, Portugal",Megalithic Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portoorca.htm,"The Orca dolmens, Portugal","The elevated granite bedrock of the Fiais region near Carregal do Sal, offered the builders of the 'Orca' dolmens both a ready source of building material, and a 360˚ view of the country extending several miles in all directions, whilst remaining in close proximity to the Mondego river. The several dolmens and passage-mounds in this area have been preserved and combine together to form the 'Curcuito Pre-historico Fiais', a signposted journey through the forest tracks of Fiais. Apart from the beautiful Orca dolmen, this circuit offers examples of rock-art (arte-rupestre), several other smaller dolmens, and various other traces from Neolithic life, all of which add to the feel of the site. The largest and most complete of all the Neolithic remains in area, the Orca dolmen is a magnificent example of a Portuguese passage-mound and has some interesting examples of prehistoric cut-marks showing on at least two of the stones (see below). The stone at the end of the chamber shows signs of having been worked.  The same carving can be seen on a stone at the nearbyOrca da Palheira. The holes in the surrounding stones suggest a door mechanism which may be a later addition.    Another passage-mound, only a lot smaller and mostly destroyed, This structure is dated at around 3,500 BC.

"Orkney Islands, Scotland",Megalithic Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/scotlandorkneys.htm,"The Orkneys Complex, Scotland","The Orkneys complex has been seen for a long time as a separate cluster of megaliths. However, it is now realised that several of the megalithic sites are connected, forming a prehistoric ceremonial landscape. The stark landscape of the Islands also offers a unique backdrop for these beautifully constructed sites, against  which they take on an ethereal quality, as the builders must have been aware. There are several prominent megalithic sites on the Orkney Islands. The availability of such good quality local stone gave these megaliths a unique quality which still remains today. Until now there has been little solid evidence for dating the sites. This year (2008), Renfew's 1973 trenches were re-opened at Brodgar, and a series of samples have been sent for radio-carbon dating(4). We await the results. It is suggested that because the the two stone circles have henges that were dug from the living rock, that the builders may have introduced this technique from elsewhere, such as England where vast henges were dug, but usually into soil. There are several features of the primary Orkneys megaliths which have similarities to other Megalithic structures from further south in Europe (i.e. Ireland, England, France), with all have similarly orientated passage-mounds, Henges, Stone-circles suggestive of astronomical observation. Also the structures themselves show strong cultural similarities through art, technique and design. At present, these people are commonly referred to as the 'Beaker-people', or 'Boat people' from the Neolithic period. A trend for migration along the western coast of Atlantic Europe can be seen from southern to northern with the Orkney complex representing the northerly most example of socio-astro-religious civil-scale constructions. Recent archaeology at the'Ness' of Brodgarhave revealed that the Orkneys placement of the monuments into the landscape shares similarities with the 'ritual' landscape at Stonehenge. It has been proposed by archaeologist Mike Pearson that the landscape represents the division between the world of the living and the world of the dead. Suggestions that the Neolithic megalith builders were closely connected with the Irish passage mound builders, for example can be seen through the art, construction and preference for orientation. This beautiful mace-head (right), was found atKnowth. The flint itself comes from theOrkney islands, which are by no means the nearest source of flint to the Boyne valley. It is one of several clues that testify to a cultural exchange between these two important megalithic complexes, along with the style of art, exterior and interior similarities in design of the passage mounds (Maes Howe) and a strong astronomical theme underlying the development of the structures. Meas Howe should not be viewed as an independent structure. It was an integral part of the prehistoric landscape, as the photo above illustrates. The whole area can be seen as an outdoor ceremonial arena, with the ever-present Hills of Hoy in the background receiving the midwinter sun and marking the new year. There were once two 'watch-stones' at the entrance to the causeway and archaeologists are currently in the process of uncovering the complex between across the causeway, believed to have once been a 'ceremonial' walled complex separating the sites. This walled enclosure is currently being revealed by archaeologists. It separates the Stones of Stenness from the Ring of Brodgar making it essential part of the landscape. It is now realised that the site is composed of as many as 100 structures, with several vast, complex, and beautifully constructed buildings) From the centre of this, the second largest circle in Britain, it can be seen how a mound was deliberately built at the same place the sun set behinds the left-hand Hill of Hoy on the winter solstice. This attempt to replicate the horizon can be seen in several other megalithic sites in Scotland where it is also generally associated with astronomical observation. Skara Brae was built by the coast, in a beautiful bay facing the setting sun. The 'village' lies in line with the great circles of Bookam, Brodgar and Stennes which are now realised to have been part of a ceremonial route, through what must have seemed a most sacred landscape through Neolithic eyes. The position of Skara Brae at the end of such a significant grouping of monuments combined with discoveries inside offers the possibility that the structures (and inhabitants) may have even been a part of the ceremonial process. At the latitude of the Orkneys the major lunar standstills north becomesalmostcircumpolar, (neither rising nor setting - with the effect that the moon 'rolls' along the horizon). Because the Earthï¿½s axial tilt has changed by nearly half a degree since the majority of the stone circles were built, this effect is no longer accurate and the latitude today would have to be 63ï¿½ north for a lunar standstill north to be truly circumpolar(5), while a truly circumpolar Moon would have been visible on the Orkneys at around 3,500 BC. Maes Howe:The entrance to the Maes-Howe passage-mound is orientated towards the setting winter solstice sun behind the prominent Hills of Hoy in the distance. The chamber was placed so that for several days before and after the winter solstice, the sunlight flashes directly into the passage not once, but twice, with a break of several minutes between each illumination. In a direction 60ï¿½ south from the centre of the Ring of Brodgar at a distance of 63 chains is the 'Watchstone' (18ft high), 42 to 43 chains further on in the same line is the 'Barnstone', (15 ft high). At the same distance of 42 or 43 chains to the north-east of the Barnstone is the tumulus of Maes Howe. The Ring of Brodgar is a stone-circle which originally consisted of 60 equally spaced megaliths. The Stones of Stennes was originally a stone-circle consisting of 12 equally spaced stones. The numbers of stones used for the circles is suggestive of base-6 mathematics, the same base upon which all time and space was measured in the ancient middle-east Burl makes note of the 'mistaken coincidence' in connection with this fact. He says of it: 'From Brodgar, where there was once 60 stones, to the Stripple stones with a probable thirty, the builders may have counted in multiples of six.Stenneshad twelve. The inner and outer rings at Balfarg have been computed at twenty-four and twelve respectively. Twenty-four has been suggested for Cairnpappel, thirty-six forArbor Low, and the same number for the devils quoits'.  Thom radically suggested that geometry was used in thedesignof certain prehistoric sites. He surveyed hundreds of European megaliths and concluded that fundamental mathematic principles, based upon a common unit of measurement (which he called themegalithic yard),had been applied in the design of certain sites. As the megalithic tradition in Europe can be traced back to at least 4,000 BC, if not earlier still, his work is still not accepted by most archaeologists, although such a strong presence of geometry should not be ignored, as is clearly suggests that the design of many sacred sites seems to have been based on a sophisticated philosophy of sacred science such as was taught centuries later by the Pythagorean school.As Professor Thom observes in his bookMegalithic Sites in Britain(1967):  ï¿½It is remarkable that one thousand years before the earliest mathematicians of classical Greece, people in these islands not only had a practical knowledge of geometry and were capable of setting out elaborate geometrical designs but could also set out ellipses based on the Pythagorean triangles.ï¿½ There are several noticeable similarities between the megalithic structures of the Orkneys, and those found at other contemporary European complexes. In particular, there are some distinct examples of art and design which appear common to the Irish passage mounds, such as those of the Boyne Valley. The discovery at Knowth of a stone axe-head from the Orkneys confirms this relationship. There are several fundamental similarities between the Orkneys 'ceremonial' complex and other contemporary complexes along the western Atlantic coast. In particular, the Orkneys provides a perfect example of the two essential components of many complexes; a prominent mound and circle in close proximity to each other. The mound, which can be seen as the 'primal hill', is often realised in the form of a passage mound although regional variations exist such as at Avebury/Silbury. On the Orkneys, the monuments were constructed so as to merge with the landscape, in such a way that the stones compliment their backgrounds. The same sensitivity is seen at other megalithic sites, but nowhere is it realised quite so well as on the Orkneys. The creation of these large-scale civil constructions represents a form of higher communication between ourselves and the universe we live in. Their intimate connection with the living landscape into which we place them connects us to the earth, and their invariable orientation towards Solar and Lunar events brings us into time, with the visibly beating heart of the universe. BothGavr'inisin France andNewgrangein Ireland were built at around the same time as Orkneys monuments (c. 3,100 BC).Along with Maes Howe, theyall have their passages aligned to mark the winter solstice. (Close to the Moons eastern major standstill). This single alignment offers the potential for the realisation of the Metonic cycle. As well as astronomical orientation, the Maes Howe passage mound has several specific construction features which are common with other European passage mounds, such as their rounded shape, lowered passageway with raised internal chambers, cruciform chambers, stone libation bowls and an absence of contemporary funerary remains. The interior floor-level of bothGavr'inisandNewgrangewere raised towards the centres. At Newgrange, the upwards-sloping passage narrows the beam of light into a thin strip. In fact, the only light that would have originally been able to enter the internal chambers would have come through the 'light-box', above the passage entrance.Light-boxes are a megalithic construction feature that have so far only been recorded at three (possibly four) sites in the UK, with two in Ireland (NewgrangeandCarrowkeel-seebelow) both having the same design, and the other two on theOrkneysin Scotland.This particular connection is very specific.

"Osireion, Egypt",Underground Temple,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/egyptabydoss.htm,Abydoss: The Osireion,"Abydoss has revealed itself to be one of the most important   archaeological sites in Egypt. It is the site of the pre-dynastic   royal graveyard, which has revealed some interesting links with Sumeria; and of the Osireion, an enigmatic underground chamber   connected to the Nile, fashioned from enormous blocksthe style of which is comparable only with that seen at the Valley temple, Giza. The temple of the Sixth Dynasty Seti I was later built over this site, which assuredly dates from an earlier time. Seti I, the second king of the 19th Dynasty was the son of Ramesses I and Queen Sitre. He reconciled with the Hittites who were becoming the most powerful state in the region. Seti I and his heir, Ramesses II campaigned against Kadesh. In Karnak he completed his father's plan by converting the court between the second and third pylons into a vast hypostyle hall. He built his vast mortuary complex at Abydos. Seti-I was enedtomb in the Valley of the Kings where he was finally entombed was vandalized and his body was relocated to Deir el Bahri. The mummy of Seti I was found at Dayru l-Bahri in 1881. These engravings have aroused much attention in the past... Their apparent similarity to modern vehicles is impelling,  but it has been suggested that they are the product oftwosets of hieroglyphs, one over the other... and however unusual that may be, the idea seems borne out by looking further along the beam... The water in the temple is an indication of the level of the Nile approx' 6.5 miles away. It measures approximately 20 x 30m, is 50ft lower and is made of a clearly different construction style to that of the temple of Seti I (Sixth Dynasty) above. The water level insde the temple is attached to the water table. As Seti-I began the search for a location for his Temple, he  was lead to a location north of Luxor in the bend of the River Nile. There he began to dig the foundation for his Temple. What he discovered was the Osireion, or the ancient temple of Osiris. Whether he actually knew that the Osireion was there, perhaps we will never know, but upon finding this ancient temple in the path of his new temple, he turned his new temple to the left. It is the only temple in Egypt that makes an 'L' turn.  The area is constructed of blocks up to 25 ft long. Almost flush with the water table and therefore the Nile, it is likely it was always part filled with water, leaving a central plinth protruding like an island in the centre. The walls surrounding the building are 20 ft thick, red sandstone. The chamber is surrounded by a ï¿½moatï¿½ with ï¿½cellsï¿½ coming off it, six to the east, six to the west, two to the south and three to the north. The whole structure was enclosed within an outer wall of limestone. This structure shows significant architectural differences to the temple above and is believed to be far older. It shows several similarities to the ï¿½Valley Templeï¿½ at Ghiza(21), which is also recognised as an early-dynasty structure. In relation to this issue, it is perhaps significant that the temple Osireion is dedicated to Osiris, while the 'Valley temple' at Giza is associated to Isis. (More on this below). 'There is no longer any doubt, then, that we have discovered what Strabo calls  the well or the fountain of Abydos. He spoke of it as being near the temple, at a great depth, and remarkable for some corridors whose ceilings were formed of enormous monolithic blocks. That is exactly what we have found. These cells were 17 in number, 6 on each of the long side. There was one in the middle of the wall at the back; in passing through it one came in the rear to the large hall which was the tomb of Osiris. A careful study of the sculptures confirmed the opinion that this was a funeral hall where the remains of the god were expected to be found. but this hall did not form part of the original edifice. It must have been constructed underground when Seti I built the temple of the god. The tomb of Osiris was very near the great reservoir. Nothing revealed its presence; the entrance to it was exactly like that to all the other cells, the back of it being walled up after they had dug through it... ...We have as yet no certain indications of the date of the construction; but the style, the size of the materials, the complete absence of all ornamentation, all indicate very great antiquity. Up to present time what is called the temple of the Sphinx at Gizeh has always been considered one of the most ancient edifices of Egypt. It is contemporaneous with the pyramid of Chefren... The layer of water in the Osireion is reminiscent of the 'Holy wells' or 'Well shrines' of pagan Britain which were noted for their healing properties, and in many cases were popular places of pilgrimage. The picture (left), is an old print of St. Triduana's reliquary chapel (well-shrine) in Edinburgh(1). Sir N. Lockyer says this on the subject: 'The orientations given by different authors are so conflicting that no certainty can be claimed, but it is possible that at Abydoss one of the mounds is not far from the amplitude shown in the tables for the sun in the Nile valley at sunset at eh summer-solstice'   It has been suggested that the Osireion and the Valley temple at Giza are contemporary structures. There are several factors which indicate that this may be the case, which would make the Osireion a 4th dynasty structure. We know that the temple of Seti I was built in the 6th Dynasty(4th Dynasty (2,613ï¿½2,498 BC),  6th Dynasty (2345ï¿½2181 BC) (7)).only a matter of a hundred years later, and in a completely different style of architecture. It is worth exploring the idea that the Osireion and the Valley temple might at least share a common theme in construction. Both structures were made from   large, unadorned and lintelled pillars. Two rows running along the length with five pillars in   each, creating a central chamber. Both structures were covered   over, and both were associated with the Nile. The Osireion has 17 chambers running along the walls while the Valley Temple has 17 sockets in the floor for statues. Naville, who excavated the site in 1913-14, immediately recognised the similarities between Khafre's Valley Temple at Giza and the Osireion, and concluded that they were of the same Old Kingdom era.  The Osireion is     associated with Osiris, and the Valley temple to Isis, his     consort and sister, as demonstrated by the Inventory Stela, discovered by Auguste Mariette in the 1850's. It reads as follows:  The association with Isis on this stela (whether from the 4th of 12th dynasty) is of particular interest as it appears to confirm the early-dynastic history of the unification of 'upper' and 'lower' Egypt and the primal Egyptian myth of Osiris and Isis, in relation to these temples. These temples suggest a commonality, whilst adhering to the theme of the Isis/Osiris myths. The Osireion is associated with Osiris, and the Valley temple to Isis, his consort, sister and mother. The Ghiza pyramids are cardinally orientated (equinoxially), while the great temples in the south of Egypt such as Karnack, Denderra and The Temple of Seti (Osireion), are orientated to the solstices. The symbolic act of unification, was not only concerned with the physical boundaries of  Egypt,  but also the solar year.  This round-topped stellae (right), of King Djet, the 4thKing of the 1st Dynasty was probably originally erected on the east side of his royal mastaba tomb. It was found in a royal necropolis at Abdyoss, where most kings of the 1st Dynasty were buried. It was created of limestone, a relatively soft stone.The Horus falcon perches on top of the rectangular serekh, which contains the hieroglyph of a cobra, the actual name of the king.  (Uadji? Djet?)  Article: Hieroglyphs Dated Back to 3,200 BC at Abydoss: Recent discoveries   at the site of Abydoss have demonstrated that Egyptian hieroglyphs   date back at least to the 32nd century BC. Notably older than earlier   estimates, these discoveries give Egypt pride of place for the oldest   known system of writing. They have also forced a revision of some   assumptions about the development of Egyptian hieroglyphs. The   existence of ideograms alongside phonetic symbols led linguists to the   conclusion that hieroglyphs began as a rudimentary series of   ideographic characters, where one sign meant one thing, independently   of the spoken word; and that the system gradually developed a phonetic   component as greater sophistication was needed. The discoveries at   Abydoss seem to contradict this model. At issue are small   tags, perforated with a hole in one corner, bearing one or more   primitive carvings similar to classic hieroglyphs. Some of these   carvings are more obviously similar to known hieroglyphs than others,   and the archaeologists dealing with them found that if these carvings   were read like standard Egyptian writing, they not only made sense in   a generic fashion, but they actually clarified the nature of the   discovery: they were tied to goods that were brought to the tomb then   under excavation, and identified the nature of those goods. Thus,   Egyptian writing was already phonetic at that early date.  This ritual knife was discovered in the Royal cemetery at Abydoss. The inscriptions on it are reminiscent of Sumerian and Mesopotamian engravings. They appear to depict a battle on one side and the 'Gilgamesh' figure flanked by two lions on the other.

"Palenque, Mexico",Pyramid Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicopalenque.htm,"Palenque, Mexico","Palenque is a relatively small Mayan complex, much smaller than such huge sites as Tikal or Copan, but it contains some of the finest architecture, sculpture, and bas relief carvings ever produced by the Maya.  A single storey building built in the shape of an irregular quadrilateral (unusual for Mayan constructions), and inside which three subterraneous 'apartments' can be found down a 180ft deep 'flight of gloomy steps'. Here are found one of the many mysteries of Palenque, in the shape of three great stone tables (alters), 'fretted with sculptured symbols'(1). Originally this tower did not have a roof. Early archaeologists reconstructing the site, ignorant of the Mayans sophisticated astronomical knowledge, did not understand the purpose of a roofless platform (for viewing the stars) and thus capped it with a roof of their own design.   The Temple of Inscriptions was   begun perhaps as early as 675AD as the funerary monument of   K'inich Janaab' Pakal.

After three years of excavating, he reached the burial chamber     in 1953. It contained a 20-ton stone coffin with a wonderfully     carved lid. Inside was the skeleton of the Mayan ruler Pakal (Pacal),     heaped with jade. The tomb is remarkable for its large   carved sarcophagus, the rich ornaments accompanying Pakal, and for   the stucco sculpture decorating the walls of the tomb. Unique to   Pakal's tomb is the 'psychoduct', which leads from the tomb   itself, up the stairway and through a hole in the stone covering   the entrance to the burial. Thispsychoductis perhaps a   physical reference to concepts about the departure of the soul at   the time of death in Maya eschatology where in the inscriptions   the phraseochb'ihaj sak ik'il(the white breath   road-entered) is used to refer to the leaving of the soul. The sole surviving portion of the stucco decoration on the Temple of the Skull (Temple XII) at Palenque is the skull above. Visitors to the ruins might notice it just as they enter the ruins, looking up at the templeï¿½s one remaining pier. The skull was clearly part of a larger composition, and its position at the base suggests it served as a pedestal for a standing figure, much like the skeletal heads beneath the feet of the royal portraits on piers of the Temple of the Inscriptions.   The four-story tower, the only one of its kind in Mayan architecture, is suggested as having been an astrological observatory. During the winter solstice on December 21, the setting sun lines up from the Palace tower to the centre of the Temple of the Inscriptions, where Pakal is buried.

The semi-circular faï¿½ade, as in the Irish passage mounds/court-tombs, was marked by two upright stones on either side of the south-facing portal. The forecourt was blocked with rows of tightly wedged stones; some of the original kerbstones around the barrow can still be seen. Within the cairn were a number of enigmatic features: a slumped stone, deliberately felled before the cairn was built, an irregular line of small stone-holes and a pit with signs of burning. ""The region, the little valley on whose side stands the Pentre Ifan cromlech, the finest in Britain, is believed to have been a favourite place with the ancient Drulds. And in the oak groves (Ty Canol Wood) that still exist there, tradition says there was once a flourishing school for neophytes, and that the cromlech instead of being a place for internments or sacrifices was in those days completely enclosed, forming like other cromlechs a darkened chamber in which novices when initiated were placed for a certain number of days....the interior (of Pentre Ifan) being called the womb or court of Ceridwen"".

"Persepolis, Iran",Persian Capital,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/iranpersepolis.htm,"Persepolis, Iran","The city of Persepolis was built in a remote and mountainous region of   modern day Iran during the reign of Darius I, who made it the capital of   Persia. The earliest remains of   Persepolis date from around 515 BC(Darius   I: 522ï¿½486BC).   To the ancient Persians, the city was known as Pārsa, which means ""The   City of Persians"". Persepolis is the Greek interpretation of the name   Πέρσης πόλις (Persēs polis: ""Persian city""). 'The stones of the ancient city of Persepolis requires urgent attention to be protected otherwise it will be destroyed in less than a decade.The penetration of rainwater inside the platform, which has formed a large pool, as well as the severe damp have caused the stonework to crack and crumble, particularly in the recent months, and within a few years the whole platform will collapse.  This is mainly due to the fact that the sewages-channels constructed by the Achaemenid engineers to direct the excess waters outside the platform have been blocked. In addition, due to the increase of subterranean waters generated from the lake formed behind the infamous Sivand Dam has caused a severe rise in damp, to the extent that can be smelt and felt in the air.' Persepolis   consists of the remains of several monumental buildings on a vast   artificial stone terrace about 450 by 300 m (1,480 by 1,000 ft). A   double staircase, wide and shallow enough for horses to climb, led   from the plains below to the top of the terrace. At the head of the   staircase, visitors passed through the Gate of Xerxes, a gatehouse   guarded by enormous carved stone bulls. Three kilometers south of     Persepolis, in the plain of Marv Dasht, lies the prehistoric     site of Tall-i-Bakun, consisting of two flat hillocks. Here in     1928, Ernst Herzfeld, of the University of Berlin, decided to     undertake a trial excavation of the western mound, where he had     previously discovered many prehistoric sherds Iying about on the     ground. Later, in 1932, he conducted more extensive excavations,     subsequently continued by Erich F. Schmidt (1935ï¿½37). The main deposits of the     western hill produced a large quantity of ceramics with     unusually beautiful painted patternsdating mostly to the     fourth millennium B.C.Unexpectedly, many rooms of the     settlement contained a substantial number of unbroken vessels,     many of them standing on the floors of the houses, sometimes     nested one in another. A great wealth of designs and variations     are seen in this cream-colored ware. Many show different     geometrical patterns, some simple, some intricate. Fewer have     beautifully stylized animal designs depicting either ibexes or     mouflons. These vessels manifest a remarkable artistic balance     between geometric ornament and animal design. Large jars,     usually made in two parts, show distinct markings characteristic     of a vessel turned by hand. Besides these pottery vessels,     numerous painted clay figurines of humans and animals were     discovered. Other ceramic objects consisted of scrapers, in the     form of stirrups, which were used for smoothing and decorating     vessel surfaces before the vessels were fired. These     scrapersï¿½although made of clayï¿½were so strong, and their     scraping edges so sharp, that they were also used for scraping     hides. In addition to this vast amount of pottery, there were     large quantities of knives, blades, and copper daggers. There     were also many button seals, mostly made of green stone, showing     beautifully incised designs. Finally, some well-preserved clay     labels and seal impressions were excavated. (2) This place is   calledNaqsh-e Rostam(Picture   of Rostam), from the Sasanian carvings below the tombs once   thought to represent the mythical hero Rostam. It seems from the   sculptures that the occupants of these four tombs were Achaemenian kings; one of those at Naqsh-e Rostam is expressly   declared in its inscriptions to be thetomb of Darius I, son of   Hystaspes. The three other   tombs at Naqsh-e Rostam, besides that of Darius I, are probably   those ofXerxes I, Artaxerxes I   (both above),   and Darius II. The two completed graves behind Persepolis   probably belong to Artaxerxes II and Artaxerxes III. The   unfinished one might be that of Arses, who reigned at the longest   two years, but is more likely that of Darius III, last of the   Achaemenian line, who was overthrown by Alexander the Great.

"Piodao, Portugal",Largest Rock-cut Spiral in the World,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portopiodao.htm,"Piodao, portugal","The discovery of numerous nearby examples of bronze-age rock-art,cart-ruts, and severalspirals, (of which the photo on the right is the largest),  has greatly re-enforced the value of visiting the area. The Spiral- This giant example of spiral-art was recently discovered near Piodï¿½o. The discovery of numerous other examples of rock-art, or 'Arte rupestre',  in the same  area (including several other spirals),  elevates the potential significance of this location on the megalithic landscape. This spiral is carved on a stone  over a metre long, which appears to be still attached to the bedrock. The top surface looks as though it may have been 'worked' into its parabolic form,  although it is equally likely that it is a natural formation, and might even be the reason for selecting this stone. It looks as though the design on top is still complete, having been carved onto the rock in the same shape we see it today. There are two or three cup-marks on the rock and on the rock next to it, which looks as though the front half of it has collapsed on the ground in front of it. One wonders whether there might be other carvings on the face down part of the rock. The design on the stone consists of a spiral which continues to become an 'animal' figure (which has been suggested as being a horse), then continues to zig-zag up and down the rock several times, before forming another shape (as yet unidentified), then zig-zags up and down again several more times before ending (or possibly starting) at the top of the rock in a distinct cup-mark.  On the rear of the stone is a 'foot-print' shaped motif (See right), a symbol which is found on several other stones in the region. The samearea has produced over 50 examples of rock-art, seemingly scattered around on the rocks, however, their abundance in such an isolated location , as well as the proximity  of many of the carvings to the cart-ruts, known locally as 'strada's real', or 'royal roads', make it likely that the area had some significance in the past. The presence of carved 'feet' and carved crosses, is suggestive of a ceremony. The association between these two symbols has been noticed before byPaturi(1), who suggested that the carved 'feet' are evidence of marriage ceremonies, and that the crosses signified the later 'Christianisation' of such areas.   Extract from Paturi(1): 'On the    Hexenstein the witches stone near Terenten... which was most certainly also a fertility rock, our Bronze age ancestors did not carve just cup forms onto the rock. It is also possible to distinguish quite clearly the imprint foot chiselled into the stone. In places this symbol on the rock carvings is relatively frequent'. Paturi continues 'Various scholars of prehistory have given different interpretations of the foot imprints'. He then quotes Karl Lukan, who maintained that the footprints are those of brides and were chiselled at the marriage ceremony. 'They were in fact marriage documents made of stone'. Interestingly, Paturi then says 'these rites were often preserved for centuries, which was a thorn in the flesh of the Christian church...The church endeavoured, often unsuccessfully, to wean its lambs from the worship of pagan deities...They decided to combat ancient magic with newly invented magic using the sign of the cross to banish witches and evil spirits'.

This   concentration of megaliths consists of a stone circle (The King's Men), a standing   stone (TheKing Stone), 73m/239ft NE) and a burial chamber (The Whispering Knights, 357m/0.2mi ESE).    There are about 77 lumps of weathered limestone forming a 31.4m (103ft)   near-perfect circle, some small enough to be almost lost in the short turf. In 18th century, the antiquarian William Stukeley described this   circle asThe greatest Antiquity we have yet seen... corroded like   worm-eaten wood by the harsh Jaws of Time.Early in the 17th century only 26 stones were standing; in 1882 there was a major re-erection of the remaining stones. There is no other stone ring near the Rollright Stones, but the circle   lies in an area ofhenges. Its name has nothing to do with any   supernatural rotation of the stones, but it may derive fromHrolla-landrihtas early spellings like Rollindricht suggest,the   land belonging to Hrolla. The ""King's Men"" is a stone circle that dates from about 2500-2000 BC. It is almost perfectly round and has a diameter of 104 ft (33 m). Originally, there may have been as many as 105 stones, but today there are 77 stones. Over a third of the stones were put back in place during the site's restoration in 1882. Aubrey Burl called the   Rollright's ï¿½seventy-seven stones, stumps and lumps of leprous   limestoneï¿½. This number has altered considerably over the years -   drawings from the tail-end of the 19th century, just before the Stones   were scheduled under the 1882 Ancient Monuments Protection Act along   with Stonehenge and Avebury, show about 25 stones in the Circle (see above). ï¿½In   the year 1882 the proprietor of Little Rollright replaced all the   fallen stones in their original foundation.ï¿½ The stones are of   heavily-weathered local oolotic limestone: antiquarian William   Stuckeley described them as being ""corroded like worm-eaten wood, by   the harsh Jaws of Time"" that make for a ""very noble, rustic, sight,   and strike an odd terror upon the spectators, and admiration at the   design of 'em"". TheWhispering Knightsare accessed by a well-maintained grassy path that leads around the outskirts of a private field. Here four stones stand upright in a tight cluster; a fifth, probably the capstone, has fallen. The stones are part of a portal dolmen-type burial chamber dating from about 4000-3500 BC, and originally projected out of a low, flat-topped platform that surrounded them. Dismembered bodies were placed in the chamber for burial. Human remains were place in the chamber for over a thousand years, well into the Bronze Age. The King's Stone(right), is a large block of limestone about 2.5 m high. This is believed to have been a marker stone for an early Bronze Age cemetery and was erected between 1800-1500 BC. Several small cairns containing cremations were discovered around the stone. The stone's unusual shape is not original; it derives from early visitors chipping away pieces to take away as talismans or for healing purposes.    The Whispering Knights are named for the conspiratorial way in which they lean in towards each other.Local legendhas it that they were plotting against their king when they were turned into stone by a witch, along with the other monuments at the Rollright's.

"Rudstone, England",Tallest Standing Stone in UK,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandrudstone.htm,"Rudstone, England","The Rudstone monument is the largest standing stone in Britain. It stands 7.8m high and estimated to weigh 26 tons. It was fashioned from grit-stone from Cayton bay, around 16 km distant. Excavations (By Sir. William Strickland) in the late 18th century suggested the monument extends as deep below the ground as it stands and although this seems unlikely, the statement remains to be verified.  There are no authorities to be depended upon in regard to either   the time, manner, or occasion of its erection. It is almost quite   grown over with moss from top to bottom. In the year 1773 its top being observed to decay through the rains   descent upon it, Mrs. Bosville ordered a small cap of lead to be put   on it in order to preserve it, which was accordingly done.  Its dimensions within ground are as large as those without, as appears   from an experiment made by ye late Sr. Wm. Strickland, of Boynton. The name Rudstone derives from the old English words meaning 'cross-stone'(4), offering the possibility that Anglo-Saxons may have once placed a cross on top in an attempt to convert it. Similar conversions were performed on several Breton megaliths, such as the standing stone atDuzec. Cursus monuments are one of the most   functionally enigmatic of prehistoric structures. Surrounding   Rudston, East Yorkshire, a cluster of at least four cursus   converges on a bend in the Great Wold Valley. Of these monuments,   Cursus A, or the 'Woldgate Cursus', is particularly unusual, with   a curving  'dog-leg' plan. The unique shape   of this structure provides an opportunity for studying cursus   morphology with the aim of interpreting its function -   essentially, why does the structure curve in this way? The Rudston group contains an   unparalleled concentration of cursus monuments. Cursus A is the   southern most of the group. The southern end of the cursus   survives as an earthwork and the remainder is visible on air   photographs as two parallel ditches. The cursus is 2700 metres   long by circa 58 metres, it tapers to 41 metres at the south   terminal.  The Great     stone was erected upon a natural spur, overlooking a striking     change in course of the Great Wolds Valley and the Gypsey Race,     which form a natural amphitheatre with the spur as its focus.     The Gypsey Race is the only permanent free-flowing water supply      in the Yorkshire Wolds. The Gypsey Race used to flow far faster in the past and has a tradition associating it with having prophetic abilities.(5) The monument   connects the Rudstone Beacon and Beacon Hill through the alignment   of a Cursus.

In chapter VI of his Seventh Book he says: ""ï¿½an Inca with royal blood left the fortress as a messenger of the Sunï¿½he left the fortress and not the Temple of the Sun, because it was said that he was a messenger of war not of peace, that the fortress was the House of the Sun"".* Pedro Cieza de Leï¿½n, Spanish chronicler of the conquest times, states in his book ""El Seï¿½orï¿½o de los Incas"" (""The Incan Dominion"") that the Royal House of the Sun was located to the north of the city of Cusco, within a collado.""* Martï¿½n de Murï¿½a, also a Spanish chronicler, states that Sacsayhuamï¿½n ""ï¿½was, at first, the House of the Sun, and nowadays it is only a witness of its ruin"". Commonly referred to as the 'Baï¿½os   del Inca' or the 'Inca baths', Tambomachay is believed to have   been a site for ritual bathing. The excellent quality of the   stonework suggests that the location was of importance to the   Incas. The ruins basically consist of 3 tiered platforms.  The top level has four trapezoidal   niches; on the next level an underground spring emerges directly   from a hole at the base of the stonework and from here cascades   down to the bottom platform, while on the lower platform the   spring water splits into two channels, both pouring the last metre   into a stone basin. The quarries for the stones are located 9 miles and 20 miles away, on the other side of a mountain range and a deep river gorge. Within a few hundred yards of the complex is a single stone that was carved from the mountainside, moved some distance, and then abandoned. The stone contains steps, platforms and depressions, probably intended as a part of the fortifications. It now sits upside-down, the size of a five-storey house.(9). The largest stone blocks at Sacsayhuaman (some of which are over 28ft high), are regularly estimated to weigh over 120 tons(2). while more enthusiastic estimates place the largest stones at 300 tons(4), 361 tons(21), 440 tons(1). So precise was the masonry that one block on the outer walls, for example, has faces cut to fit perfectly with 12 other blocks. Other blocks were cut with as many as 36 sides. All the blocks were fitted together so precisely that a thickness gauge could not be inserted between them. The Muyuqmarka consists of three   concentric, circular stone walls connected by a series of radial   walls. There are three channels constructed to bring water into   what many scientists consider to be a reservoir. A web-like   pattern of 34 lines intersects at the centre and also there is a   pattern of concentric circles that corresponded to the location of   the circular walls.  Originally,the   Myuqmarka was a building with 4 superposed floors. The first body   would have had a square floor; the second would have been   cylindrical; the third would have had also a cylindrical shape.   The successive would have formed circular cultivation terraces   with decreasing width, being the widest of 3.6 m and the narrowest   of 3 m. The tower would have ended up in a conic ceiling. Muyu   Marca must have reached a total height of 20 meters. It was as   amazing work that generated the admiration of several chroniclers.   The Spaniards destroyed it, in spite of the protests both from   Cieza and Inca Garcilaso.(3) A tunnel measuring 2 km in length, linking the Koricancha temple with the fortress of Sacsayhuaman, located on the outskirts of the Peruvian city of Cuzco, was discovered by Spanish archaeologist Anselm Pi Rambla, in the ancient Inca capital. The tunnel may form part of a series of galleries, chambers, fountains and ancient mausoleums which are probably under the city of Cuzco, according to measurments made by Pi Rambla as part of the Wiracocha Project, initiated in August 2000.The Spanish scholar stated before the Peruvian Congress's Cultural Commission that he had discovered the subterranean passageway, which in his opinion, ""may change perspectives on Peruvian history.""According to radar images obtained by Pi Rambla, the tunnel links directly to the Temple of the Sun or Korikancha, with the Convent of Santa Catalina or Marcahuasi, with the Cathedral or Temple of Inca Wiracocha, with the palace of Huascar, with the Temple of Manco Capac or Colcampata and with the Huamanmarca.All of these buildings are in a perfect astronomical alignment, which confirms that ancient Peruvians also guided their constructions by the location of the Sun, the Moon and the constellations. Access to a tunnel at the Sacsayhuaman Fortress was already known, but it was condemned in 1923 to avoid the disappearances of curiosity seekers who entered it, since its trajectory was unknown. ""We calculate that it would be some 100 meters under Cuzco...the great question is ascertaining what age it belonged to,"" adds the archaeologist. In May, Pi Rambla will spearhead the excavation work aimed at confirming the location of the subterranean galleries which confirm the stories of chroniclers like Garcilaso de la Vega and Cieza de Leï¿½n regarding an underground citadel in Cuzco.

Salisbury Complex,Ancient Meridian,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandsalisbury.htm,The Salisbury Complex,"There are several noticeable concentrations of Neolithic sites along the western Atlantic coast. These prehistoric complexes can be seen at locations as far apart as the Orkneys in Scotland, the Boyne Valley in Ireland, Carnac in France and Evora in Portugal, all of which share similar features and all are contemporary. The Salisbury landscape retains the same indelible fingerprint of unprecedented civil-scale prehistoric activity and the remains of some of the largest prehistoric monuments from the ancient world. Landmarks such as Stonehenge, Avebury and Salisbury dominate the prehistoric the landscape, but other sites such as Durrington Walls, The Sanctuary, West Kennet Long-barrow and Old Sarum (to name but a few), were also parts of this ancient landscape, all operating together to create what is often termed a 'sacred' or 'living' landscape. Archaeology has revealed that associations do exist between these complexes (through discoveries of both Grooved-ware and Beaker-ware), and while it is not yet possible to say that there was a direct connection, the arrangement of monuments at each complex can be seen to provide the means for an accurate localised measurement of both the cycles of the sun and moon, and evidence suggests that the distribution and placement of the most prominent European monuments goes beyond random selection (see below). Suggestions of astronomical observations in the region can be seen dating back over 8,000 years (through the Stonehenge Post-holes). It is perhaps no coincidence that theGoseck Hengein Germany lies on the same latitude as Stonehenge supporting the idea that the preference for this latitude was no coincidence. The astronomical significance of this latitude (being the specific latitude at which the maximum zeniths of the sun and moon cross at 90ï¿½ of each other), is a clear suggestion behind the motivation for such intense construction activity, but without a more complete context the overall picture of events eludes us. However, recent observations are starting to show that not only is the local landscape woven together, but that it extends outwards to other important and contemporary prehistoric sites leading to a suggestion of the deliberate separation of complexes according to a basic set of basic astronomical and geometric principles. The Wiltshire complex includes some of the largest man-made constructions from the prehistoric world leaving no doubt as to the importance of the area. (The estimated man-hours for Silbury and Avebury alone are in the region of 5 million man-hours). We now know that the majority of the works in the area were carried out over a broad period of around 600 years, with two distinct periods of construction (c. 3,100 and 2,400 BC). The original reasons, driving force, and the  organisation behind such civil-scale activity is unknown to us and we are forced to speculate on much today, but there are certain clues which suggest that the design and arrangement of these huge civil structures was aimed at creating a larger arena, uniting the Salisbury landscape in an unprecedented way. Human activity in the region extends back to the Mesolithic era, and continues to the present day. The complex can be loosely divided into two groupings of significant sites; The northern group which includes Avebury, Silbury, The Sanctuary and West Kennet long-barrow, and the southern group which includes Stonehenge, Old Sarum, The Cursus, Durrington Walls, and the newly discovered 'Bluestone circle'. Why this particular area was chosen, and what it was original function was are still amongst the most challenging questions about the complex. The appearance of the Avebury monuments would have been completely different when they were first completed, more in line with other large monuments in Britain, being covered with a white surface of chalk from which they were dug. Silbury Hill would have seemed like a snow covered mountain, and the ditch and bank of the Avebury circle would have shone white against the surrounding landscape. Likewise would have been the mounds of the numerous long-barrows and tumuli that were commonplace in the area. It is of interest to note that the earlier passage tomb of Newgrange in Ireland's Boyne Valley included a spectacular surround of white quartz when it was built. This quartz was quarried in the Wicklow Mountains some 50 miles away indicating that some Neolithic builders would make a great effort to give their constructions a white appearance.Excavation of the three large Henges at Thornborough in Yorkshire revealed that the banks of these substantial earthworks were deliberately made to appear white by the application of layers of gypsum which had to be transported to the site(s). Whether this has any connection with Avebury is yet another question our Neolithic ancestors have left us to consider All the sites within the Wiltshire complex have different designs and presumably served different functions to different peoples at different times, being built over a period of several hundred years, but the resulting combination marks one of the largest Neolithic complexes in the world, and requires a better understanding  in order to explain the context behind such energy and design.The division of the complex into two distinct clusters of sites, with the Stonehenge grouping in the South and the Avebury grouping in the North is of clear importance and perhaps it is through the connectivity between these sites that we can begin to learn their association and purpose. Geographically, the Northern Avebury cluster is the terminal point of both the Ridgeway and the Icknield way. Although there appears to be no physical connection today, it is likely that the River Avon was used to convey people from the northern area to the southern area, as it starts only a mile or so south of Avebury and flows south directly past Durrington Walls, Stonehenge and Old Sarum, then on south to the coast. Archaeologists have found four, or possibly five largeMesolithicpostholes which date to around 8,000 BC, beneath the nearby modern tourist car-park A thousand years before Stonehenge, Avebury or Silbury existed, the (3km long) Cursus had been built in the area (c.3,630 - 3,375 BC) All these indications are that the region already held a special significance to the future builders of these great monumentsbeforethey built them. Of interest perhaps, that a similar construction to the original design of Stonehenge was built on the same latitude atGoseckin Germany, but long before Stonehenge was constructed (c. 5,000 BC). This particular latitude is the only latitude at which the sun and moon have their maximum azimuths at right angles to each other, a feature which was included in one of the earliest features at Stonehenge in the shape of the Station-stones. The importance of the area appears to have culminated in two intensive construction phases at around 3,000 BC and again c. 2,400 BC. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Salisbury Complex is home to both the largest man-made mounds in Europe, the most sophisticated stone circle and the two largest Henges in the World. The tens of millions of man hours involved in creating all the monuments during this time are only surpassed by the overall planning and design involved, something which is often ignored, but which suggests the presence of sophisticated cultures. A lack of burials beneath Silbury hill precludes the notion that it was a ritual burial mound, so how are we to explain the impetus behind such  structures?. The discovery of Beaker-ware at most of the sites in discussion, leaves little doubt as to who the builders of these great monuments were, but we are told that the Beaker people arrived in England c. 2.500 BC. with the earliest examples of their pottery being found in Iberia c. 2,900 BC.(15)which precludes them from the earliest phases of work, but places them exactly in the right place and at the right time for the majority of the works c. 2,500 -2,400 BC. The question remains however, in what context was such work undertaken?. The Beaker people's arrival c. 2,500 BC can be seen as part of a wave of immigration that occurred along the Mediterranean basin and the Western coast of Europe at that time. Sites that had already been in use such as Carnac, Boyne Valley, Salisbury, and the Orkneys all show evidence of great building works at this time, but they also show that the monuments were built overexistingMegalithic centres. Putting it simply, it seems that the Beaker people arrived and almost immediately began to adapt or convert existing significant monuments (and their meaning) in perhaps a similar way the Romans integrated cultures into their empire as they expanded throughout Europe and beyond. If, as it seems, the important important megalithic complexes were already in place when the Beaker people arrived, there is still the question of who originally conceived and initiated such grandiose works. Before their arrival for example, the first (and arguably most important) phase of works had already been carried out at Stonehenge, with other sites such as Old Sarum and the Sanctuary showing signs of activity at the same time (c. 3,100 BC). This same pattern is repeated at other Megalithic complexes along the Atlantic coast of Europe and in each case we see the common theme of adaptation rather than initiation. Stepping back several hundred years to the initial phase of construction (c. 3,100 BC) takes us into a largely unknown yet globally significant period of prehistory. At present our knowledge of events at this time is limited as it also signifies the beginning of the written record, and trying to reconcile evidence of such a concerted exercise with our knowledge of what we know from this time relies on an element on speculative research. So where are we to look for the skills and organisation required to initiate such large scale works?. The primary candidate at present is the ignominiously named 'Grooved-ware' people. Pottery from this culture has dominated our impression of them, but it was these people that brought the first Henge monuments to Britain (likely an adaptation to the cursus), with discoveries being found at Newgrange, the Orkneys, Thornborough, Arbor Low and Salisbury. It is currently speculate that the 'Grooved-ware' people originated within Britain, probably in the region of Ireland or Scotland, extending southwards c.3,000 BC. Stonehenge: First Construction Phase: 3,100 BC(6). This is the same time that work begins on the Northern section of the Salisbury complex, at both Avebury and Old Sarum. In addition, civil-scale constructions simultaneously appear in the Boyne Valley, Ireland, Carnac in France, Evora in Portugal, on the Orkney Islands in Scotland and on Malta. It is noticeable that this exact time is also ascribed to the start of the Egyptian dynasties and pyramid building. It will be shown that all of these locations share a common theme in construction, geometry and astronomy. They are also related through Geodesy, by separation through units of degrees of longitude and latitude (based on a 360 division of the globe). The specific location of the Stonehenge monument c. 3,100 BC placed it approximately 15 miles south ofthe northern Avebury cluster. The 'Sanctuary', which later became connected to the Avebury monument, shows activity from the same time period and was built on the same longitude of 1ï¿½ 49' W and is exactly 1/4ï¿½ north revealing the first of many 'coincidences' regarding the placement of other significant sites in relation to these two markers. (see below) The Bluestone Circle: The stone circle at 'Bluestonehenge' was eventually replaced by a henge, a circular ditch nearly 74 feet across with an external bank. Broken antler pickaxes in the ditch date its construction to about 2470 BC to 2280 BC. At least one entrance has been discovered, on the east side, and it contained a specially placed deposit of antlers, an antler pickaxe, cattle bones and stone and flint tools.  The team also found the riverside end of the avenue to Stonehenge. It was marked by two parallel ditches about 54 feet apart. These originally held posts, forming a small palisade on either side. The avenue apparently terminated at or close to the outer bank of the newly discovered henge.Archaeologist Josh Pollard of Bristol University, a co-director of the project, noted that the circle ""should be considered an integral part of Stonehenge rather than a separate monument, and it offers tremendous insight into the history of its famous neighbour.""  Previous research had shown that Stonehenge originally consisted of 56 bluestones set in a circle inside a ditch and bank. Sometime about 2500 BC, those stones were moved to their current location, leaving behind the holes now known as Aubrey holes. But there are 80 bluestones in Stonehenge and only 56 Aubrey holes, Parker Pearson said. Durrington Walls: The first timber circle c. 2,600 BC was oriented southeast towards the sunrise on the midwinter solstice and a paved avenue was also constructed on a slightly different alignment ï¿½ towards the sunset on the summer solstice which led to the River Avon. Old Sarum: The Sanctuary: This importance of this site has gone unnoticed for a long time, but its natural position as the entrance to the Avebury complex hides another startling fact, which is that its location places it at approximately 1/4 of a degree north of Stonehenge, and they both lie on the exact same longitude.  This revealing clue is one of several key facts which suggest that the monuments of the Salisbury complex were located at deliberately significant astronomical, geometric and geographic locations which united the landscape in the eyes of the builders. Avebury: The two stone avenues (Kennet Avenue andBeckhampton Avenue) that meet at Avebury define two sides of triangle that is designated aWorld Heritage site and which includesThe Sanctuary,Windmill Hill,Silbury Hilland theWest Kennet Long Barrowand Beckhampton Cove. Many of these sites were in existence before Avebury was constructed. Avebury is situated half way along the St. Michael's Ley, (on the ancient path of the Iknield way), which was aligned to the sun on Beltane (A cross-quarter day marking the first day of Summer). The Avebury complex also represents the southern terminus of the Ridgeway. Avebury is located at the latitude (360/7 = 51.42857). Silbury Hill: Silbury sits in the centre of the Avebury complex, almost hidden from view for the most part. The top of the hill has a way of lining up with the horizon level from several angles, and is inter-visible with both Avebury and the Sanctuary. The hill was originally thought to have been deliberately surrounded by water, being positioned over the source of the River Kennet. This design feature has led to suggestions of it representing the 'primal mound', or the belly of the pregnant 'earth mother'.  The West-Kennet Avenue:Constructed c. 2,400 -2,200 BC to connect the pre-existing Sanctuary to Completed Avebury monument.Excavations byStuart Piggott andAlexander Keiller in the 1930s indicated that around 100 pairs of standing stones had lined the avenue (at this time only 4 remained standing), and that they dated to around 2,200 BC based on finds ofBeaker burials found beneath some of the stones. Running for a length of over half a mile, the 50ft wide avenue is often suggested to have been composed of alternating male/female (lozenge/phallic) shapes, however, only a sad few remain today.  The Beckhampton Avenue:  Beckhampton Cove and Long-Barrow:  Marlborough Mound:Dated to 2,400 BC  Thefirst modern astronomical observations of the monuments on the Salisbury landscape were recorded at the turn of the 20th century by Sir Norman Lockyer (then the Astronomer Royal), who noticed both that the avenue at Stonehenge was orientated along the path of the Summer Solstice sun,  and that Stonehenge, Grovely Castle and Old Sarum formed a near-perfect equilateral triangle, with each side 6 miles in length (All of these alignments are now known to extend onwards to other prehistoric sites).These connections, both astronomical and geometric set the foundation for future observations of the monuments in the area. Alfred Watkins 'stumbled' across the theory of Leylines, followed closely by Prof. A. Thom, who continued his research along the same lines as Lockyer, eventually revealing the (still controversial) common unit of measurement which he called the Megalithic Yard. He became convinced of the existence of skilled 'elite' group of people (i.e. astronomer/priests) who organised the design of many of the major European constructions - we are reminded of the suggestions of an emerging Neolithic 'elite' in the shape of the 'Grooved-ware' people. Having taken a look at the individual sites, it is now worth looking closer at the connections between sites. Apart from the obvious connection between the Sanctuary, Avebury and Beckhampton in the shape of the West-kennet and Beckhampton avenues, other sites such as Silbury, which was not connected physically, can be seen to be integrally linked through their specific locations and inter-visibility with other noticeable sites. For example, Avebury, Silbury Hill, the West Kennet Avenue and both the East and West-Kennet long-barrows are all visible from the Sanctuary. From Avebury, Windmill Hill and  the Sanctuary, the top of Silbury hill lies in line with the horizon, while from the West Kennet Long-Barrow, the top of Silbury appears to be on the same level. These ground observations all add to the otherwise unseen aspects of the symmetry between the monuments and the landscape. Of more fundamental importance but less visible to the naked eye, are the connections between sites through astronomy and geometry. The addition of these elements greatly adds to the significance of the monuments, reinforcing their symbolism and extending their presence beyond their physical footprint to unify the landscape, but it also reveals a system of measurements that suggests a higher level of knowledge to these builders than is normally accredited.  It is a particularly interesting fact for example, that apart from being positioned on the same line of longitude as Stonehenge, the Sanctuary, which was occupied at the same time is positioned exactly 1/4 degree north of Stonehenge. This remarkable fact connects both the Northern and Southern clusters of the Salisbury complex in a single earthly measurement (based on a 360 division of the globe). The same apparent recognition of earthly measurements is seen in the fact that Stonehenge was built on a latitude mirrored by the zenith of the summer solstice sun, while the Avebury monument was built on a latitude (51.428) which is the result of 360/7. Other important ancient sites such as Delphi in Greece and both Giza and Karnack in Egypt also conform to this system of geodetic placement. (More on this below). There has been a gradual recognition in recent times that certain stones at megalithic sites appear to have been carried long distance to their final destinations. There is a clear suggestion here that individual qualities of stone were a consideration in the construction of 'sacred' sites. The effort required to transport stone were presumably balanced by their importance. Several sites have now been recognised as being composed of 'pieces of places', something which would seem to play an important role in the development of the Salisbury monuments, especially in light of the famed 'Sarsen Stones' transported from Wales for the first phase of construction at Stonehenge. In all, at least 20 rock types have been identified at Stonehenge   The connection between these two prominent and contemporary Salisbury monuments in itself is a challenge, but to take matters further, it seems that these alignments extend onwards to other prominent Neolithic sites, also being separated by units of degrees, and/or the same Geodetic placement associated with astronomy and geometry. It can be seen, for example that the same line continued another 1 1/2 degrees north arrives atArbor-Low'The Stonehenge of the North', constructed at around 2,400 BC, but with activity extending back to c. 4.000 BC. Arbor Low is in return aligned geodetically with several other significant British monuments such as Bryn Celli Ddu and Callanish. The latitude of Arbor-Low (53ï¿½ 10' N) is the   same angle as that produced by the 3:4:5 Pythagorean Triangle. It is   also coincidentally the same as the exterior angle of theKhafre Pyramidat Giza. These facts lend weight to the suggestion of acommonunderlying system of geodesy in operation through the placement of ancient and significant sacred sites. Silbury shares a curious 'coincidental' geometric connection with the Great pyramid of Giza, in that the exterior angle of the great pyramid is mirrored in the latitude of Silbury, which in turn shares its exterior angle with the latitude of Giza. It is perhaps of interest in relation to this that the dimensions of the top of Silbury are the same as the circumference of Stonehenge (revealed to be a quarter-aurora in Egyptian measurements). The result of this circumference is that each degree on the horizon measures half a megalithic yard. This association between the exterior angles of pyramids and the latitude can be seen elsewhere in the Middle east, and as we have seen, the latitude of Arbor Low is associated with both fundamental geometry, and lies on the Salisbury meridian, exactly 2ï¿½ north of Stonehenge, something which suggests a similar set of principles underlying the placement of European monuments. We have seen that the earliest phase of construction at Salisbury involved both Stonehenge and the Sanctuary amongst others, both these monuments appear to be related through their longitudes and latitudes, being exactly 1/4 degree of latitude apart, while lying on the exact same longitude. The implication of a deliberate separation between sites, presumably working away from Stonehenge, offers a new perspective on the context behind the Salisbury complex. It is proposed in this context, that the Salisbury complex was the focal point for the creation of a prehistoric European Meridian, from which other relevant megalithic sites deliberately positioned, according to longitude/latitude and astronomic observation. The same has been suggested for the Giza complex in Egypt. 'They do not think it proper to commit these utterances to writing, although in all other matters and in their public and private accounts they make use of Greek characters. I believe that they have adopted the practice for two reasons- that they do not wish the rule to become common property, nor those who learn the rule to rely on writing and so neglect the cultivation of memory; and, in fact, it does usually happen that the assistance of writing tends to relax the diligence of the student and the action of memory...They also lecture on the stars in their motion, the magnitude of the Earth and its divisions, on natural history, on the power and government of God; and instruct the youth in these subjects'(seeDe Ballo Gallico,VII, 15, 16.).  The li Stonehenge,AveburyandGlastonburyform a right angled triangle, of whichthe Glastonbury-Avebury follows the azimuth of the sun on 'Beltane'. This triangle is accurate to within 1/1000th. Glastonbury lies exactly 1 degree east of Arbor Low. Stonehenge is a part of the proposed Landscape 'Decagon', centred on Whiteleaved Oak and discovered by John Michell. The Station-stones have been shown to have been a prominent part of the original Stonehenge monument. They define the extremes of the moons and suns cycles, and an association between them and the location of the Bluestones, from which the monument was originally composed has been determined in the shape of a Pythagorean triangle across the landscape. Lundy Island shows activity from both the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods(17). Robin Heath and John Mitchell suggested that Stonehenge, Lundy Island and Preseli  form together to make a 5:12:13 Triangle, the second in the Pythagorean set. The dimensions are 2,500 times the size of the 'Station Stone' rectangle.It is particularly noticeable that theRollrightsstone-circle is located at(51ï¿½ 58′ 20″ N,1ï¿½ 34′ 19″ W), which is almost exactly on the top right-hand corner of the rectangle, with both Glastonbury and Avebury lying on the same alignments.    It is common knowledge that at the very time all this construction work was being carried out on Salisbury plains (c, 3,100 - 2,400 B), the Mediterranean was alive with activity, with the emergence of other cultures also beginning to  build astronomically orientated buildings on an unprecedented scale (most noticeably on Malta and in Egypt). While there is yet any evidence of direct contact between these Mediterranean cultures and those on the Western Atlantic, an argument is building in favour of this very idea and similarities between the underlying applications of geometry and astronomy (and art) in the constructions seems to favour this idea. Perhaps it is now worth exploring this proposition.  The 'World Hill' (Mount Meru) or the 'Primal Mound' is a concept that appears in several ancient traditions (Most noticeably Indus Valley, Sumerian and Egyptian) in which it was  considered to be the centre of the physical, metaphysical and spiritual universe. TheSurya Siddhanta,one of the earliest Hindu doctrines (siddhanta) in archeo-astronomy, describes that Mt Meru lies in 'the middle of the Earth' (""Bhugol-madhya"") The theme of a combination of a prominent Mound being built beside a stone-circle (often surrounded by water) can be seen to be repeated at the same time in history and across Europe and the Mediterranean, for example:Maes-Howein the Orkneys,Gavrinisin France,Boyne Valley, Ireland andGgigantijain Malta to name but a few. The complex at Evora is not surrounded by water butZambujeirais the largest passage mound in Europe and sits within view of one the oldest stone stone-circles in Europe -Almendres. While this theme is suggestive of a male-female balance in structures, it can also been seen as an extension of the mythological 'Primal Mound'. The theme of aligning 'Mounds' or 'Beacon Hills' is commonly seen across Britain and beyond, with the primary example being theSt. Michael's Leywhich runs across England From St. Michaels mount in Cornwall through several distinct, natural and man-made beacon hills (Most noticeably Glastonbury and Silbury Hill), along the alignment with the path of the sun on St. Michael's day (Beltane), evidence of the intrinsic connectivity between the builders, the monuments, the landscape and the cyclic motion of the heavens at this time. We have seen that two of the earliest megalithic sites on the Salisbury complex (Stonehenge and the Sanctuary) have associations that appear to be based on earthly measurements: Most significantly, the placement of the Sanctuary exactly 1/4 degree north of Stonehenge, and Arbor Low a further 1.5ï¿½ north on the same longitude. The association of other significant sites such as Glastonbury, Bryn Celli Ddu, Callanish and the Orkneys with the same geodetic fingerprint clearly begins to suggest a means of calculating the longitude/latitude of one site in relation to another. Something which even today, is not officially recognised before the Greeks. There are however, several stubborn facts which require answers in order to dismiss them from the possibility of such a scheme: Newgrange was constructed c. 3,200 - 2,900 BC (Wiki), In early Irish mythology, Newgrange was not only the alleged burial place of the prehistoric kings ofTara, but also the home of a race of Irish supernatural beings, known as 'Tuatha de Danann': The people of the goddess Danu. If the archaeology is correct, these same people are now rather ignominiously referred to as the 'Grooved Ware' people. Apart from being built at the same time, Newgrange shares other similarities with the monuments at Salisbury. It is noticeable for example that the Newgrange monument originally consisted of a stone circle beside a cursus, as at Stonehenge. The passage mound itself is orientated along the path of the Midwinter sun, while Stonehenge was orientated with the Midsummer sun. These two major monument complexes are not only situated at one one-hundredth of the earth's circumference apart, but it has been calculated that at Avebury (when obliquity equalled precisely 24 degrees), the level summer solstice sunset pointed precisely to Newgrange(22). Burl notes that the diameter of the bank at Brodgar is almost exactly 175 megalithic yards, the same as the inner circles of the Avebury and Newgrange monuments in England and Ireland respectively.(16) There is another curious similarity between Newgrange and Avebury in that original Stone circle at Newgrange had 97 stones (rather than 98 at Avebury), which suggests the possibility of a primitive alternative to the Metonic Cycle, as 98 lunar months is the same as 8 solar years.  The number 97 has another astronomical significance, as it is a relevant number in the calculation for leap years. We know that there are either 366 or 365 days in the solar year. The Gregorian calendar, which was designed to subvert the necessity for adding random days repeats completely every 146,097 days, which fill 400 solar years. Of these 400 years, 303 common years have 365 days leaving a need for 97 'leap' years, each with 366 days. This yields a calendar mean year of exactly 365+97/400.days = 365.2425 days.  The Orion constellation held a fascination for many ancient cultures and featured strongly in mythology and we can say with a pretty good measure of confidence, that it is also associated through the design in several prehistoric monuments. Apart from the obvious association with the Giza pyramids, it is noticeable that there are a large number of Triple-Henges and Stone circles in the British Isles which appear to have the same 'Dog-leg' in the angle between them. The most prominent of these is the three Thornborough Henges for which Prof. Clive Ruggles has made a clear connection to Orion, both in physical design and in orientation, but other prominent sites such asThe Hurlersand Avebury are also suggested. Although largely dismissed today, the third circle at Avebury was originally discoveredin 1937 by 'A. Keiller', who found three 'unrecorded stone holes, eleven metres apart on the arc of a circle about 103m in diameter, much the same as the 'North' and 'South' inner circles. The centre of this third circle was on the same North-north-west to South-south-east axis as the others and Keiller concluded that ""it seems impossible therefore not to conclude that what one may term as 'Avebury I' consisted of three settings of stones...unaccompanied by banks or ditches"". Of additional interest is the dimensions of these Henges, as there are other Henges in UK with similar measurements. The three Henges at the Thornborough complex are exactly double the size of Stonehenge and the Dorchester Henge (Which lies along the St. Michael's ley). It has been calculated that the particular circumference of Stonehenge would allow for 1/2ï¿½ of horizon every 1 MY (using a division of 366ï¿½)(26). This means that from the centre of the Henges at Thornborough (Which is exactly double the size), each 1ï¿½ of horizon would measure 1 MY along the flattened top of the surrounding banks. There have been several suggestions of similarities between Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Apart from the fact that they were both started at approximately the same time, the most noticeable similarity is in the exterior angle of the Great pyramid, the latitude of Stonehenge and the orientation of the avenue (along the summer solstice), all of which are 51ï¿½ 51', both of which were noticed by Sir Norman Lockyer at the turn of the 20th century. We have already seen that Avebury is located at exactly the latitude 360/7, and it seems relevant that the Giza complex is located at latitude 360/12. According to Peter Le Mesurier, the Sarsen-ring (whose official inner diameter is 97ft or 1162.8 primitive inches), has a circumference of 3652.4 primitive inches, which he suggested as indicating a knowledge of the Solar year, it is also exactly one 'quarter-aroura', as measured in ancient Egypt(26), andthe same dimension that was used for the top of Silbury hill.  According to Peter Le Mesurier Flinders Petrie calculated the diameter at 1167.9 (+/- 0.7 British inches) (13), which works out at 1166.6 Primitive inches (giving a circumference of 3663.1 primitive inches), which although still accurate to within .03%, is not as exact as Le Mesurier suggested. ",,,,"These prehistoric complexes can be seen at locations as far apart as the Orkneys in Scotland, the Boyne Valley in Ireland, Carnac in France and Evora in Portugal, all of which share similar features and all are contemporary.
Landmarks such as Stonehenge, Avebury and Salisbury dominate the prehistoric the landscape, but other sites such as Durrington Walls, The Sanctuary, West Kennet Long-barrow and Old Sarum (to name but a few), were also parts of this ancient landscape, all operating together to create what is often termed a 'sacred' or 'living' landscape.
Archaeology has revealed that associations do exist between these complexes (through discoveries of both Grooved-ware and Beaker-ware), and while it is not yet possible to say that there was a direct connection, the arrangement of monuments at each complex can be seen to provide the means for an accurate localised measurement of both the cycles of the sun and moon, and evidence suggests that the distribution and placement of the most prominent European monuments goes beyond random selection (see below).
The astronomical significance of this latitude (being the specific latitude at which the maximum zeniths of the sun and moon cross at 90ï¿½ of each other), is a clear suggestion behind the motivation for such intense construction activity, but without a more complete context the overall picture of events eludes us.
However, recent observations are starting to show that not only is the local landscape woven together, but that it extends outwards to other important and contemporary prehistoric sites leading to a suggestion of the deliberate separation of complexes according to a basic set of basic astronomical and geometric principles.
The original reasons, driving force, and the  organisation behind such civil-scale activity is unknown to us and we are forced to speculate on much today, but there are certain clues which suggest that the design and arrangement of these huge civil structures was aimed at creating a larger arena, uniting the Salisbury landscape in an unprecedented way.
The complex can be loosely divided into two groupings of significant sites; The northern group which includes Avebury, Silbury, The Sanctuary and West Kennet long-barrow, and the southern group which includes Stonehenge, Old Sarum, The Cursus, Durrington Walls, and the newly discovered 'Bluestone circle'.
This quartz was quarried in the Wicklow Mountains some 50 miles away indicating that some Neolithic builders would make a great effort to give their constructions a white appearance.Excavation of the three large Henges at Thornborough in Yorkshire revealed that the banks of these substantial earthworks were deliberately made to appear white by the application of layers of gypsum which had to be transported to the site(s).
Whether this has any connection with Avebury is yet another question our Neolithic ancestors have left us to consider All the sites within the Wiltshire complex have different designs and presumably served different functions to different peoples at different times, being built over a period of several hundred years, but the resulting combination marks one of the largest Neolithic complexes in the world, and requires a better understanding  in order to explain the context behind such energy and design.The division of the complex into two distinct clusters of sites, with the Stonehenge grouping in the South and the Avebury grouping in the North is of clear importance and perhaps it is through the connectivity between these sites that we can begin to learn their association and purpose.
Although there appears to be no physical connection today, it is likely that the River Avon was used to convey people from the northern area to the southern area, as it starts only a mile or so south of Avebury and flows south directly past Durrington Walls, Stonehenge and Old Sarum, then on south to the coast.
Archaeologists have found four, or possibly five largeMesolithicpostholes which date to around 8,000 BC, beneath the nearby modern tourist car-park A thousand years before Stonehenge, Avebury or Silbury existed, the (3km long) Cursus had been built in the area (c.3,630 - 3,375 BC) All these indications are that the region already held a special significance to the future builders of these great monumentsbeforethey built them.
Sites that had already been in use such as Carnac, Boyne Valley, Salisbury, and the Orkneys all show evidence of great building works at this time, but they also show that the monuments were built overexistingMegalithic centres.
Before their arrival for example, the first (and arguably most important) phase of works had already been carried out at Stonehenge, with other sites such as Old Sarum and the Sanctuary showing signs of activity at the same time (c.
Pottery from this culture has dominated our impression of them, but it was these people that brought the first Henge monuments to Britain (likely an adaptation to the cursus), with discoveries being found at Newgrange, the Orkneys, Thornborough, Arbor Low and Salisbury.
This is the same time that work begins on the Northern section of the Salisbury complex, at both Avebury and Old Sarum.
The 'Sanctuary', which later became connected to the Avebury monument, shows activity from the same time period and was built on the same longitude of 1ï¿½ 49' W and is exactly 1/4ï¿½ north revealing the first of many 'coincidences' regarding the placement of other significant sites in relation to these two markers.
The avenue apparently terminated at or close to the outer bank of the newly discovered henge.Archaeologist Josh Pollard of Bristol University, a co-director of the project, noted that the circle ""should be considered an integral part of Stonehenge rather than a separate monument, and it offers tremendous insight into the history of its famous neighbour.""  Previous research had shown that Stonehenge originally consisted of 56 bluestones set in a circle inside a ditch and bank.
Old Sarum: The Sanctuary: This importance of this site has gone unnoticed for a long time, but its natural position as the entrance to the Avebury complex hides another startling fact, which is that its location places it at approximately 1/4 of a degree north of Stonehenge, and they both lie on the exact same longitude.
This revealing clue is one of several key facts which suggest that the monuments of the Salisbury complex were located at deliberately significant astronomical, geometric and geographic locations which united the landscape in the eyes of the builders.
2,400 -2,200 BC to connect the pre-existing Sanctuary to Completed Avebury monument.Excavations byStuart Piggott andAlexander Keiller in the 1930s indicated that around 100 pairs of standing stones had lined the avenue (at this time only 4 remained standing), and that they dated to around 2,200 BC based on finds ofBeaker burials found beneath some of the stones.
The Beckhampton Avenue:  Beckhampton Cove and Long-Barrow:  Marlborough Mound:Dated to 2,400 BC  Thefirst modern astronomical observations of the monuments on the Salisbury landscape were recorded at the turn of the 20th century by Sir Norman Lockyer (then the Astronomer Royal), who noticed both that the avenue at Stonehenge was orientated along the path of the Summer Solstice sun,  and that Stonehenge, Grovely Castle and Old Sarum formed a near-perfect equilateral triangle, with each side 6 miles in length (All of these alignments are now known to extend onwards to other prehistoric sites).These connections, both astronomical and geometric set the foundation for future observations of the monuments in the area.
Apart from the obvious connection between the Sanctuary, Avebury and Beckhampton in the shape of the West-kennet and Beckhampton avenues, other sites such as Silbury, which was not connected physically, can be seen to be integrally linked through their specific locations and inter-visibility with other noticeable sites.
For example, Avebury, Silbury Hill, the West Kennet Avenue and both the East and West-Kennet long-barrows are all visible from the Sanctuary.
From Avebury, Windmill Hill and  the Sanctuary, the top of Silbury hill lies in line with the horizon, while from the West Kennet Long-Barrow, the top of Silbury appears to be on the same level.
The addition of these elements greatly adds to the significance of the monuments, reinforcing their symbolism and extending their presence beyond their physical footprint to unify the landscape, but it also reveals a system of measurements that suggests a higher level of knowledge to these builders than is normally accredited.
It is a particularly interesting fact for example, that apart from being positioned on the same line of longitude as Stonehenge, the Sanctuary, which was occupied at the same time is positioned exactly 1/4 degree north of Stonehenge.
The same apparent recognition of earthly measurements is seen in the fact that Stonehenge was built on a latitude mirrored by the zenith of the summer solstice sun, while the Avebury monument was built on a latitude (51.428) which is the result of 360/7.
Several sites have now been recognised as being composed of 'pieces of places', something which would seem to play an important role in the development of the Salisbury monuments, especially in light of the famed 'Sarsen Stones' transported from Wales for the first phase of construction at Stonehenge.
In all, at least 20 rock types have been identified at Stonehenge   The connection between these two prominent and contemporary Salisbury monuments in itself is a challenge, but to take matters further, it seems that these alignments extend onwards to other prominent Neolithic sites, also being separated by units of degrees, and/or the same Geodetic placement associated with astronomy and geometry.
It can be seen, for example that the same line continued another 1 1/2 degrees north arrives atArbor-Low'The Stonehenge of the North', constructed at around 2,400 BC, but with activity extending back to c.
This association between the exterior angles of pyramids and the latitude can be seen elsewhere in the Middle east, and as we have seen, the latitude of Arbor Low is associated with both fundamental geometry, and lies on the Salisbury meridian, exactly 2ï¿½ north of Stonehenge, something which suggests a similar set of principles underlying the placement of European monuments.
We have seen that the earliest phase of construction at Salisbury involved both Stonehenge and the Sanctuary amongst others, both these monuments appear to be related through their longitudes and latitudes, being exactly 1/4 degree of latitude apart, while lying on the exact same longitude.
The implication of a deliberate separation between sites, presumably working away from Stonehenge, offers a new perspective on the context behind the Salisbury complex.
It is proposed in this context, that the Salisbury complex was the focal point for the creation of a prehistoric European Meridian, from which other relevant megalithic sites deliberately positioned, according to longitude/latitude and astronomic observation.
They define the extremes of the moons and suns cycles, and an association between them and the location of the Bluestones, from which the monument was originally composed has been determined in the shape of a Pythagorean triangle across the landscape.
The dimensions are 2,500 times the size of the 'Station Stone' rectangle.It is particularly noticeable that theRollrightsstone-circle is located at(51ï¿½ 58′ 20″ N,1ï¿½ 34′ 19″ W), which is almost exactly on the top right-hand corner of the rectangle, with both Glastonbury and Avebury lying on the same alignments.
It is common knowledge that at the very time all this construction work was being carried out on Salisbury plains (c, 3,100 - 2,400 B), the Mediterranean was alive with activity, with the emergence of other cultures also beginning to  build astronomically orientated buildings on an unprecedented scale (most noticeably on Malta and in Egypt).
TheSurya Siddhanta,one of the earliest Hindu doctrines (siddhanta) in archeo-astronomy, describes that Mt Meru lies in 'the middle of the Earth' (""Bhugol-madhya"") The theme of a combination of a prominent Mound being built beside a stone-circle (often surrounded by water) can be seen to be repeated at the same time in history and across Europe and the Mediterranean, for example:Maes-Howein the Orkneys,Gavrinisin France,Boyne Valley, Ireland andGgigantijain Malta to name but a few.
The theme of aligning 'Mounds' or 'Beacon Hills' is commonly seen across Britain and beyond, with the primary example being theSt. Michael's Leywhich runs across England From St. Michaels mount in Cornwall through several distinct, natural and man-made beacon hills (Most noticeably Glastonbury and Silbury Hill), along the alignment with the path of the sun on St. Michael's day (Beltane), evidence of the intrinsic connectivity between the builders, the monuments, the landscape and the cyclic motion of the heavens at this time.
We have seen that two of the earliest megalithic sites on the Salisbury complex (Stonehenge and the Sanctuary) have associations that appear to be based on earthly measurements: Most significantly, the placement of the Sanctuary exactly 1/4 degree north of Stonehenge, and Arbor Low a further 1.5ï¿½ north on the same longitude.
Apart from being built at the same time, Newgrange shares other similarities with the monuments at Salisbury.
It is noticeable for example that the Newgrange monument originally consisted of a stone circle beside a cursus, as at Stonehenge.
These two major monument complexes are not only situated at one one-hundredth of the earth's circumference apart, but it has been calculated that at Avebury (when obliquity equalled precisely 24 degrees), the level summer solstice sunset pointed precisely to Newgrange(22).
Burl notes that the diameter of the bank at Brodgar is almost exactly 175 megalithic yards, the same as the inner circles of the Avebury and Newgrange monuments in England and Ireland respectively.(16) There is another curious similarity between Newgrange and Avebury in that original Stone circle at Newgrange had 97 stones (rather than 98 at Avebury), which suggests the possibility of a primitive alternative to the Metonic Cycle, as 98 lunar months is the same as 8 solar years.

Clive Ruggles has made a clear connection to Orion, both in physical design and in orientation, but other prominent sites such asThe Hurlersand Avebury are also suggested.
Apart from the fact that they were both started at approximately the same time, the most noticeable similarity is in the exterior angle of the Great pyramid, the latitude of Stonehenge and the orientation of the avenue (along the summer solstice), all of which are 51ï¿½ 51', both of which were noticed by Sir Norman Lockyer at the turn of the 20th century.
We have already seen that Avebury is located at exactly the latitude 360/7, and it seems relevant that the Giza complex is located at latitude 360/12.
According to Peter Le Mesurier, the Sarsen-ring (whose official inner diameter is 97ft or 1162.8 primitive inches), has a circumference of 3652.4 primitive inches, which he suggested as indicating a knowledge of the Solar year, it is also exactly one 'quarter-aroura', as measured in ancient Egypt(26), andthe same dimension that was used for the top of Silbury hill.",United Kingdom,Europe

It is also one of the largest examples of its kind in the world.For over a thousand years this site served as a ceremonial centre for various pre-Colombian cultures, ultimately including the Inca who erected great temples and turned the site into the capital of the eastern most reaching province of their empire. In the words of UNESCO: ""The huge sculptured rock, dominating the town below, is a unique testimony to pre-Hispanic and beliefs, and has no parallel anywhere in the Americas."" Archaeology of the site has revealed that several phases of occupation were present at Samaipata. Before the Spanish were the Inca, and beneath the foundations of the Inca works evidence of previous cultural works was found, proving that the site was in use a long time before the might Inca.(5)So who were the people that originally carved the hill..? The site is now generally considered to be a pre-Incan site, built by theChanï¿½ people, a pre-Inca culture ofArawak origin,(3)who migrated from Guyana approximately 2,500 years ago.(6)It is suggested that the first engravings at El Fuerte were undertaken during the Mojocoyas period (AD 200 ï¿½ 800)(7).Unfortunately, the exact chronology of the site is yet to be determined for the period between theChanï¿½ and the Inca, but the evidence suggests that there is more than one building phase at Samaipata. The site was later occupied by the Inca who used it as their most advanced post of the Empire, of which it marked the frontier from the late 15th century until its fall in 1530. It was the administrative centre in charge of maintaining the order of the Inca in the region, but its principal function was keeping at bay the frequent invasion attempts of the Guarani Indians.(1)They gave it the name of ""Samaipata"", which is Quechua (language of the Incaï¿½s) and stands for 'The Height to Rest' or 'Rest in the heights', and they added several classic Inca-style masonry constructions to the complex. Around 1540 theSpanisharrived and encountered an Inca fortress. They renamed the site ""El Fuerte"" or ""The Fortress"", and deserted the site around 1629 when they founded the settlement known today as Samaipata a few Km away. 'The orientation of the carved trail is the direction of the rise of the Pleiades at about 1AD. An observer at the top of the hill could see the rising of the Pleiades at around 500AD, and also the rising of Regulus in 600AD. The alignment of the 8 pits points to the rise of the Pleiades at 500BC and of Aldebaran at 500AD. The long rectilinear engraving  near the seats complex to the East matches the rise of the Pleiades at about 500BC. If we consider that the Pleiades cluster ('Collca' in the quechua or 'Qutu' in the aymara languages) was important in the Andean world as a celestial signal for sowing (mainly maise) or for the prediction of yields, then it is possible to think that the alignments found at Samaipata were devised for the observation of this star cluster. Accordingly, the monument should have been built between 1AD and 500 or 600AD. Perhaps the eight pits were used first and the 'cascabel' later on, as a more recent construction. Of course only the archaeological research may work out a precise dating for the monument.(2) The carved circular seating arrangement known as theCoro de los Sacerdotes(Choir of the Priests) is carved at the top pf the rocky oucrop. Here, with an most incredible panoramic view, 12 seats were deeply into the hilltop in a circle (7m in outside diameter). Within the circle of 12 is another set of seats, which are placed back-to-back and face outward toward the 12 seats. The circle includes triangular and rectangular niches cut into its walls. The structure bears vague similarities to the 'Cuzco Sundial' or the 'Eye of the Jaguar' at Cuzco.  Most of the southern face of the rock was originally dominated by a series of at leastfive temples or sanctuaries, of which only thenichescut into their walls survive. These niches vary widely in size, shape, and orientation, but their design indicates the temples were built in the Inca period.  About 100m from the site is the yet unexplored Chincana. The Chincana, are tunnel systems, such as the one on Lake Titicaca, which is now exposed. The leading historians believe it was an escape route in case of attack or a tunnel that comes from within the stone complex above, while other suggestions includeit being a cemetery, or a mini-version of a 'cenote' for worshipping at. The Camino de la Chinchana was a tunnel that began as a two-meter opening to a pit that went straight down for about 6 meters. Once one had made the first descent down to the floor of the pit, something that would take a rope or a ladder, then one would find himself standing in a tunnel that was high enough and wide enough for a man to stand without stooping. This tunnel then descended downhill from the fort, apparently going in a northwest direction. According to the caretaker of Samaipata, the tunnel had been explored once by Bolivian archaeologists who had entered the pit with a rope and had advanced some 100 meters or more into the tunnel. The air became stale and a small cave-in had blocked a portion of the tunnel. Without proper breathing gear, the team was unable to advance any farther into the earth.(4) The archaeological site of Quenko, close to Cuzco has several similarities to the Samaipata carvings. It was an Inca religious centre with a large semi-circular ampitheatre and seats of stone.

"Sanctuary, The, England",Concentric Stone Circles,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandsanctuary.htm,"The Sanctuary, England","The Sanctuary, situated on Overton Hill next to the Ridgeway and nearAvebury, was begun around 3,000 BC.(1).  It originally comprised   six concentric rings of timber uprights. Later, the timbers were replaced   by two double stone circles of sarsen stones, the largest being 39.5m in   diameter. The site, of which only the post and stone holes remain today   (now marked by concrete blocks) was destroyed in 1723 and 1724   for farming land, but not beforeWilliam Stukeleymade a drawing of it.

Dating suggests that the first structures were there slightly before the construction of either Avebury or Silbury Hill, although other prominent structures such as West Kennet and Windmill hill henge etc. Much of what once existed here will remain speculation. It seems that the site was host to  large wooden roundhouse here, with archaeological evidence of ceremonial activities and feasting. It is suggested that the roundhouse was increased in size twice, leaving three progressively larger sets of concentric holes. Somewhere around 2,100 BC(2), two concentric circles of stone were set in its place.  Extract From:(The Ancient History of Wiltshire by Sir Richard Colt Hoare). 'It was, (alas! it was) a very few years ago, crowned with a most beautiful temple of the druids. They still call it the Sanctuary. I doubt not but it was an asylum in Druid times, and the veneration of it has been handed down through all succession of times and people. It had suffered a great deal when I took the prospect of it with great fidelity, in 1723. Then farmer Green took most of the stones away to his building at Beckhampton, and in the year 1724 farmer Griffin ploughed half of it up; but the vacancy of every stone was most obvious, the hollows still left fresh. In the winter of the same year, the rest were carried off, and the ground ploughed over' The Sanctuary is an important part of the both the local landscape and is integral to the overall design of the Salisbury Landscape. It not only lies at the foot of the Ridgeway and The West-Kennet River, but represents the first step in a ceremonial route that leads to Avebury, then the Beckhampton Cove (avoiding Silbury altogether), via the West Kennet and Beckhampton Avenues, built 500 years later and revealing the continuing importance of the location as the entrance to the whole complex. It is also incidentally, one of the only local vantage points from which all the other important sites in the area can be seen at the same time. The megalithic ruins on the Salisbury landscape can be seen as integral parts of an overall design on Salisbury. although it is difficult to see today, these monuments were deliberately positioned in order to align with each other, astronomical observations and the natural landscape features on Salisbury.

The town of San Agustin is set in the middle of the   valley and is the best place from where to visit them.The dozens of megalithic   sites nestled in the valleys of the Magdelena River combine to make this   site exceptional. The site are composed of mounded tombs, dolmen-like   structures and monolithic stone structures (linked to the 'Jaguar cult' by   some-see right). The pre-Incan civilization that lived here is shrouded in mystery, even their actual name is still unknown. Archeologists have uncovered amere 10 percent of the statues and ruins, and it is theorized that huge mayan-like pyramids and other structures remain buried throughout the area. Other than the amazing statues, you can see burial chambers and ritual edifices in the Parque Arqueologico and huge petroglyphs spread throughout the valley. There have been comparisons made with the Mayans of central America, and if you follow the Rio Magdalena north from San Agustin you will see that it begins on the Atlantic coast of Colombia very near the equally famous ruins of the ""Ciudad Perdida,"" a likely landing point if the Mayans took a boat ride from the Yucatan Peninsula or crossed the Darien Gap into Colombia from Panama. It should be noted that carbon dating between San Agustin and Ciudad Perdida matches the same general time period of 555 BC to 1630 AD (from ""San Agustin"" by Reichel Dolmatoff, 1972). As far as culture and society, archaeologists have determined a few things: The San Agustin people treated women as equals and superiors (they did have female leaders), they had a grasp of advanced mathematics, they attempted complex surgeries and they were obsessed with the idea of life after death. People were ritualistically sacrificed, burned alive and sometimes buried alive under the influence of hallucinogens. 'The San Agustin   region is located in the upper Magdalena River valley and is framed by   the Central and Eastern Cordilleras. As the site of the most striking   progression of monumental statuary, this part of Colombia has long   attracted the attention of social scientists. The ethnic history of   the region has been interpreted based on two different chronologies.   One of them, established by Luis Duque Gomez and Julio Cesar Cubillos,   postulates the theory of continuous development separated into an   Archaic period. from 3300 to 1000 B.C., a Formative period divided in   two phases: (Inferior, from 1000 to 300 B.C_ and superior. from 200   B.C. to 200 A.D.), a Regional Classical period from 300 A.D. and a   Recent period from 800 A.D. until the arrival of the Spaniards. The   other chronological theory was developed by Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff.   According to this archaeologist there might have been three principal   phases, marked by abrupt changes indicating the arrival of different   peoples. These stages are defined as: Horqueta, the beginnings are   undecipherable but it ends in 50 A.D.; Isnos, from 50 to 400 A.D., and   Sornbrerillos from 1400 to 1650 A.D. The two opinions coincide on some   significant points. Firstly, that the development of monumental   architecture, one of the most characteristic remains of the region.   corresponds to eras prior to the Spanish incursion. Duque and Cubillos   place the statuary's maximum level of development within the Regional   Classical period. from 300 to 800 A.D., while Reichel-Dolmatoff has   determined the highest development to have occurred between 50 to 400   A.D.. during the Isnos phase. Secondly, they concur that the builders   of the mounds and statuary belong to population phases associated with   an era during which the local economy was heavily dependent upon the   cultivation of maize'. Gold-working development follows along the following lines: In various parts of the region, hammered gold tubular and round necklace beads, diadems, wires, nose ornaments, gold rings with stone beads, H shaped diadems and gold covered seashells have been discovered throughout the region in association mound burials. These objects, which correspond to the statuary development, reflect ties with Calima, southern Imabaya and Tolima goldwork developments. On the other hand, the discovery of smelted drops of gold and fragments of golden sun rays in addition to the presence of alluvial gold in the regions's rivers - particularly Manzanares and Sombrerillos - point to the local production of those metallic objects. The last phase of San Agustin gold-working is poorly documented. However, the few existing references suggest the elaboration of turnbaga nose rings. In other words, once again the large, spectacular hammered gold pieces disappear, being replaced by the production of large quantities of smaller objects. using the lost wax process.(3) ","(1.8799122, -76.2702092)",1.8799122,-76.2702092,"The San Agustin archaeological park in Colombia includes a wide variety of stone sculptures, mostly carved between AD 100 and 1200.

Two of the uprights have broken over time and this has left an opening which creates the impression that the dolmen has a west-facing orientation, while the small opening on the eastern side is actually the original opening.

"San Lorenzo, Mexico",Olmec City,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicosanlorenzo.htm,"San Lorenzo, Mexico","Early Olmec culture had emerged centred around the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlï¿½n site near the coast in southeast Veracruz. They were the first Mesoamerican civilization and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed. Among other ""firsts"", there is evidence that the Olmec practiced ritual bloodletting and played the Mesoamerican ballgame, hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies. San Lorenzo is best known today for the colossal Olmec stone heads unearthed there, the greatest of which weighs onwards of 40 tons(3)and is 3 metres high. Until the early 1900's, the Maya civilization was considered to be the parent culture in Mesoamerica from which all other societies sprouted. There have been many Mayan sculptures and carvings found in the region, so all other carvings were also considered to be that of the Maya. One difference in the carving is that some carvings of large heads had faces with more African looking features than many of the other Mayan works. There was also evidence of a half-jaguar half-man beast, which also did not fit in with other Mayan finds. It wasn't until 1929, when Marshall H Saville, the Director of the Museum of American Indian in New York, classified these new works as an entirely new culture not of Mayan heritage. He named this culture Olmec, which means the ""rubber people."" San Lorenzo was the largest city in Mesoamerica from roughly 1,200 B.C. to 900 B.C. at which time it had begun to be overtaken by the Olmec centre ofLa Venta. By 800 BCE, there was little or no population, although there was an important re-colonisation of the San Lorenzo plateau from 600 to 400 BCE and again from c. 800 to 1,000 B.C. San Lorenzo seems to have been largely a ceremonial site, a town without city walls, centred in the midst of a widespread medium-to-large agricultural population. The ceremonial centre and attendant buildings could have housed 5,500 while the entire area, including hinterlands, could have reached 13,000. A royal processional aligned to the north-south axis of the plateau led the way to the centre. At the centre of the site are two palaces: the San Lorenzo Red Palace and the Stirling Acropolis. The Red Palace was a royal residence with a platform substructure, red floors, basalt roof support, steps and drain. The Stirling Acropolis may have been the sacred residence, and is surrounded by a pyramid, E-group and a ball-court. San Lorenzo also boasted an elaborate drainage system which used buried, covered, channelled stones as a type of ""pipe"". Some researchers have inferred that the purpose of this system was not only to provide drinking water for the population but for ritual purposes as well, and that the rule was ""intimately linked to the figure of a patron water supernatural"".(2) It has been argued that the presence of the giant Olmec stone heads is proof of an Pre-Columbian African presence in America. The Stone heads at La Venta in particular have been commonly cited as having 'Negroid' features(3), Ten(5)were discovered at San Lorenzo, four atLa Ventaand others at Tres Zapotes. The largest at San Lorenzo is said to benine feet, four inches high, and is estimated to weigh around 40 tons.(3) Ten colossal stone heads representing heads of past and present rulers have been found at San Lorenzo. Evidence suggests that these heads were plastered and painted in bright colours. They were arranged in ensembles and set in a plaza paved with red sand and yellow gravel. Sarcophagus-shaped thrones linked living kings with their ancestors.(5) In 1939, an excavation of an Olmec site found a stela, which changed all views on the Maya being the oldest civilization. One side had Olmec carvings while the other showed a row of dots and bars, believed to be a dating method. According to the numbers on the stela, the Olmec had recorded a date almost 300 years earlier than that of the earliest Mayan carved monument.(4) ","(17.7548451, -94.7626868)",17.7548451,-94.7626868,"Early Olmec culture had emerged centred around the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlï¿½n site near the coast in southeast Veracruz.

Saqqara represents the first complete model of the typical pyramid complex including enclosure walls and a causeway.  The step pyramid is believed to have been initiated by the third dynasty pharaoh Djoser and designed by his vizier Imhotep. It is considered by Egyptologists to be theOldest Pyramid in the world. The Step-pyramid is believed to have evolved from an original 'Mastaba' form which was later built upon and extended several times until it attained its present shape. It was built from local limestone and cased in the better quality Tura limestone.

It was   impossible to doubt it. This buried Sphinx, the companion of fifteen   others I had encountered in Alexandria and Cairo, formed with them,   according to the evidence, part of the avenue that led to the Memphis   Serapeum...It did not seem to me possible to leave to others the credit and profit of   exploring this temple whose remains a fortunate chance had allowed me to   discover and whose location henceforth would be known.

The sacred bulls were buried in a single block of granite that weighed   between sixty and eighty tons. All twenty-four sarcophagi had been   plundered. Their lids had been praised loose and the contents taken.   Further excavation revealed an older gallery and then another one further   on. The way into the first of the galleries was blocked by a huge rock   which was blown apart with explosives. Beneath where the rock had been,   was found a mummy of a man. This was the mummy of a son of Ramasses II,   Prince Khaemwese. He was in charge of the restoration of the Pyramid of   Unas. He was also governor of Memphis and a high priest of Ptah. He had   requested to be buried with the sacred bulls rather than a tomb of his   own. The mastabas at Saqqara display some interesting features. Three of the tombs had an associated mud-brick boat burial on their north side and some of the mastabas also had raised platforms which ran around them. The heads were modelled out of mud but the horns were real, and it has been estimated that a tomb might have been surrounded by up to three hundred of them. Throughout Egyptian history the bull was closely associated with kinship. The pharaoh was referred to as 'Mighty Bull' The superstructure of the tomb shows evidence of 30 niches and 34 projections along its periphery. The structure was built on a wide platform on which, placed at reguar intervals, were clay bovine heads with real horns. At the rate of 7 to each niche and 4 on the facade, there would have been a total of 346. The bull played a considerable role in the Old kingdom, and in the pyramid texts the King is often called 'The Bull of the Sky'. But because of its horns the bull was also related to the moon. Thus it is tempting to note that the number of bull heads here approximates to that of 12 lunations (354 days), and extremely close to the number of days which Sir Fred Hoyle related to the periodic return of eclipses.(3) ","(29.8684624, 31.2168246)",29.8684624,31.2168246,"Saqqara was the   necropolis and sacred   centre for the great city of Memphis, the remains of which can be seen   nearby.

"Sardinia, Italy","Giant's Graves, Nuraghi",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/italysardinia.htm,"Sardinia, Italy","Sardinia is currently an autonomous region of Italy and the second largest island in the Mediterranean after Sicily. Although there is evidence of human occupation from the Palaeolithic, the island was only permanently settled from around 6,000 BC in the early Neolithic,(1)probably from Corsica, or the continent via Corsica. The Tombs of Giants, so called because of their gigantic dimensions, are another typical element of Sardinia's megalithic period. Usually the frontal part of their structure is delimited by some sort of semicircle (exedra), almost as to symbolize a bull's horns (Many Tombs of Giants are also oriented towards the Taurus' constellation, precisely towards the brightest star, Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri). This is the case of the Tombs of ï¿½S'Ena e Tomesï¿½ in Dorgali, ï¿½Goronnaï¿½ in Paulilatino and ï¿½Baddu Pirastruï¿½ in Thiesi(5). Viewed from above the shape of the Tombs of Giants has also been said to mind that of an uterus or a woman in labour. This interpretation confirms how closely connected  life and death were for nuraghic people and how their structures were linked to the cult of fecundation.The Tombs of Giants are scattered throughout the island. So far about 320 have been found, but it is thought that Sardinia may still be hiding many more of them.  TheGiants Tomb of Olbia(1500 to 1100 BC). The central stone has been removed revealing the main structure which lies behind it, which can only be described as an Alï¿½e Couverte. The monuments are the result of at least two stages of development; the first being the construction of an internal megalithic burial chamber, and the second being the external forecourt, believed to be for congregations, a similar design as seen in front of the temples onMalta. The thirty-six tombs are cut from or made of sandstone, sharing some common design features: a series of steps down from the entrance and a descending passage to a large burial chamber with smaller connecting chambers. Many of the 36 tombs have doorways carved to simulate trilithons. (A feature with stark similarities to those seen in theHypogeum, on Malta). Many of the doorways are carved to imitate smoothly dressed trilithons, but what makes Anghelu Ruju famous are the carvings of long-horned bulls' heads in and around three of the tombs (numbered 19, 20 and 30). These symbols were sometimes painted in red ochre, and they have been interpreted in different ways. It is worth noting that many of the human bones found in the tombs were lying under a sheet of white shells; this could indicate that most of the ancient Sardinians buried here were fishermen. Among the many grave goods dating from 2200 to 1700 BC found at Anghelu Ruju, there are obsidian, barbed and flint arrowheads, an axe and an awl from Ireland, a copper ring from East Europe, copper daggers from Spain, Beaker pottery, small marble statuettes, and spiral wire beads. Something which attests to the strong and extensive trading in operation at that time. From about 1,500 BC onwards, villages were built around the round tower-fortresses callednuraghi(Northern Sardiniannuraghes, Southern Sardiniannuraxis, plurals ofnuragheandnuraxirespectively), which were often reinforced and enlarged with battlements. The boundaries of tribal territories were guarded by smaller lookoutnuraghierected on strategic hills commanding a view of other territories. Today some 8,000 - 10,000 nuraghi dot the Sardinian landscape(4). According to some scholars the nuragic peoples are identifiable with theShardana, a tribe of the ""Sea Peoples""(2) They had various rooms and floors, corridors, cells, internal staircases, even parapets, for they were true miniature castles, built to dominate the surrounding countryside. Architecturally, there are similarities to structures of the ancientMycenaeancivilization on Crete, such as the 'Tholos' - beehive shaped internal chambers, leading some scholars to believe that these original Sardinian stonemasons came from that part of the Mediterranean. The remains of dozens of thesenuraghiare still found throughout the island, primarily in the north. To breach the Nuraghe of Barumini, enemies had to reach a small entrance located about 7 meters high, making ""Su Nuraxi"" in the eyes of the enemy an impenetrable fortress. Even today, after the excavations carried out by the archaeologistGiovanni Lilliu in the 50s, the only entrance to the fortress is the ""sky door"". Lilliu's archaeological excavations proved that Su Nuraxi was being inhabited until the third century AD.(3) There is no absolute consensus on the function of the nuraghi: speculation ranges from religious temples, ordinary dwellings, rulers' residences, military strongholds, meeting halls, or a combination of the former. Some of the nuraghes are, however, located in strategic locations ï¿½ such as hills ï¿½ from which important passages could be easily controlled. They might have been something between a ""status symbol"" and a ""passive defence"" building, meant to be a deterrent for possible enemies. It has been noticed that they are often inter-visible, and where they are not, smaller intermediate versions were built, suggesting continuity for signalling. Small-scale models of nuraghe have often been excavated at religious sites (e.g. in the ""maze"" temple at the Su Romanzesu site near Bitti in central Sardinia). Nuraghi were often located next to temples, specifically water temples. (This theme is expanded on below). The work of Juan Belmonte and Mauro Zedda has studied 272 simple and 180 complex nuraghi; they noted that the orientation of the door was always turned towards the south-east, where the sun was known to rise. Indeed, they argue that several of the windows in the nuraghi have solar, lunar and/or stellar alignments. One such astronomical phenomenon was observed in the Nuraghe Aiga di Abbasanta. Here, the summer solstice sun entered into the construction itself and creates an impressive solar display. Such solar alignments argue strongly for a religious function, if only partial, as such alignments clearly have no defensive qualities. In the Bronze age two dramatic events took place that had their repercussions on the east and the west Mediterranean, including Sardinia. The first event was the decline of the palace culture of the Minoan period on Crete and the rise of the Mycenaean's, between 1500 and 1400 BC. The second event was the time of the incursions of the Sea People in Egypt and the decline of the Mycenaean palace culture, around 1200 BC. It was around 1200 BC that on Sardinia complex nuraghi were built, an amplification of a central nuraghe with one or more additional towers, a small courtyard and even additional defensive walls and minor towers. Lilliu has called this periodLa bella etï¿½ dei nuraghi, the climax of the nuraghe-culture.  In the case of thesacred well of Santa Cristinain Paulilatino-Oristano, it has been assessed that thanks to the hole situated on the tholos vault,  the moon is reflected on the well. This happens during a predefined period, that is to say at the utmost declination of the moon, every 18 years and 6 months. Thanks to the staircase, the sunï¿½s light is reflected in the well during the autumn equinox (between the 22nd and the 23rd of September) and also during the spring equinox (between the 20th and the 21st of March).The moonï¿½s peculiarity has been noticed also in other wells; also the solar reflection is sometimes visible during the summer solstice (between the20th and the 21st of June).

This interpretation confirms how closely connected  life and death were for nuraghic people and how their structures were linked to the cult of fecundation.The Tombs of Giants are scattered throughout the island.
The monuments are the result of at least two stages of development; the first being the construction of an internal megalithic burial chamber, and the second being the external forecourt, believed to be for congregations, a similar design as seen in front of the temples onMalta.
The thirty-six tombs are cut from or made of sandstone, sharing some common design features: a series of steps down from the entrance and a descending passage to a large burial chamber with smaller connecting chambers.
Architecturally, there are similarities to structures of the ancientMycenaeancivilization on Crete, such as the 'Tholos' - beehive shaped internal chambers, leading some scholars to believe that these original Sardinian stonemasons came from that part of the Mediterranean.
To breach the Nuraghe of Barumini, enemies had to reach a small entrance located about 7 meters high, making ""Su Nuraxi"" in the eyes of the enemy an impenetrable fortress.
Lilliu's archaeological excavations proved that Su Nuraxi was being inhabited until the third century AD.(3) There is no absolute consensus on the function of the nuraghi: speculation ranges from religious temples, ordinary dwellings, rulers' residences, military strongholds, meeting halls, or a combination of the former.
Small-scale models of nuraghe have often been excavated at religious sites (e.g. in the ""maze"" temple at the Su Romanzesu site near Bitti in central Sardinia).
The work of Juan Belmonte and Mauro Zedda has studied 272 simple and 180 complex nuraghi; they noted that the orientation of the door was always turned towards the south-east, where the sun was known to rise.
The first event was the decline of the palace culture of the Minoan period on Crete and the rise of the Mycenaean's, between 1500 and 1400 BC.
The second event was the time of the incursions of the Sea People in Egypt and the decline of the Mycenaean palace culture, around 1200 BC.
It was around 1200 BC that on Sardinia complex nuraghi were built, an amplification of a central nuraghe with one or more additional towers, a small courtyard and even additional defensive walls and minor towers.
Lilliu has called this periodLa bella etï¿½ dei nuraghi, the climax of the nuraghe-culture.",Italy,Europe
"Sechin Complex, Peru",Casma Valley Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/perusechinalto.htm,"The Sechin Complex, Peru","The Sechin complex in the Casma Valley was the capital of a pre-Incan culture located on the northwest coast of Peru, occupied between approximately 1,800-900 BC. The site is remarkable for its enormous mound, the largest of its time period, measuring some 990 feet long, by 825 feet wide by 145 feet tall.The mound was faced with granite blocks, some weighing over 2 tons. Sechin Alto's great size may represent a 1000 year building span.  The similarity in mound forms and site   layout of Sechin Alto, Taukachi-Konkan, and Sechin Bajo, combined with   the coincidental orientation of all three sites both provides evidence   of contemporaneity of the sites and suggests that they may once have   formed part of a single, large, continuous settlement which occupied   land on both sides of the Sechin River, being now interrupted by   modern civilisation.(2) Sechin Alto is   believed to be part of the larger Sechin Alto Complex that covers some   4 square miles (10.5 sq km) and includes three other sitesï¿½Sechin Bajo,   Taukachi-Konkan, and Cerro Sechin. These sites all share a coincident   architectural orientation up the valley and have architectural traits   in common, such as rounded corners, circular courts, and the use of   cone-shaped adobes.(1) Sechin   Alto is located on the left margin of the Sechin River, along the road   to Huaraz.  This temple site is the largest of the Pre-Columbian   monuments of Peru, and is the largest of the Casma Valley structures.    It was constructed from dressed stone and ""conical"" style adobe, with   a U-shaped monument plan covering about 200 hectares. Five plazas   extend about a mile (1.4 km) from the huge central mound, three with   central sunken courts, one of which is about 250 ft (80 meters) in   diameter. The main mound is 44 meters high by 300 meters by 250   meters., making it the largest single construction in the New World   during the second millennium B.C. Its alignment is   magnetic E32 N, and the main entrance is up-valley towards the   northeast. All of the outlying mounds are coincident with respect to   orientation, and most examples with distinguishable features are also   generally U-shaped. The construction materials for the Sechin Alto   mound consists mainly of granite blocks quarried from hillsides about   2Km to the south, all of which were wet-laid with a silty clay mortar.   Many of these blocks, especially along the main mound face are huge,   measuring over 1.5 metres.(2) Julio Tello was the first archaeologist   to survey Sechin Alto in the late 1930s;In1956, brief testing byDonald CollierandDonald   Thompsonyielded two radiocarbon dates of ca.690B.C.and ca.1450B.C.that were in reverse order   compared to the excavation stratigraphy. Nevertheless, architectural   and ceramic data from later surveys in1968byRosa FungandCarlos Williamsand in1980byShelia PozorskiandThomas Pozorskiindicate that Sechin Alto and the larger Sechin   Alto Complex date to the Initial Period (1800ï¿½900B.C.).(1)   Slighty northwest of   the site of Sechin Alto, and clearly visible from the top of its main   mound. Although the clusters of mounds and plazas on either edge of   the plain were formerly treated as separate sites (Thompson 1961:   211-217), an examination of air photographs revealed a set of   connected and associated architectural features. The total complex   covers an area of about 1250m by 500m. As at Sechin Alto,   most of the structures are constructed of granite blocks quarried from   nearby hillsides; all of the blocks were laid in a silty clay mortar.   The constructions were also orientated along an axis of E32 N. Inhabited for much of   the second millennium B.C., Cerro Sechin has been the most intensively   studied site in the Sechin Complex. It covers roughly 50,000 meters   squared and consists of a quadrangular three-tiered stepped platform   flanked on each side by two smaller buildings. The platform was   constructed in several stages using conical adobes, or large sun-dried   bricks with broad circular bases and tapered points, which were then   set into clay mortar and plastered over to form wall surfaces. The retaining wall,   roughly 4.15 meters (13.5 feet) tall and containing nearly 400 granite   sculptures, was added relatively late in the site's history and   encircled the perimeter of the building. The stone sculptures,   undoubtedly the most famous feature at Cerro Sechin, depict a possible   mythological or historical scene in which a procession of armed men,   probably important personages or warriors, make their way among the   mutilated remains of human victims. Given the gruesome nature of the   stone frieze, it seems likely that some degree of warfare, violence,   and/or raiding existed among these early valley peoples. The Sechin Valley   is also home to theenigmatic, 2,300-year-old ruin named the 'Chankillo'. Archaeologists   have nicknamed the ruinï¿½s central complex the ï¿½Norelco ruinï¿½ based on   its resemblance to a modern electric shaver. The buildingï¿½s true   purpose long eluded them. Its thick walls and hilltop location   suggested it was a fort, but why, researchers wondered for a long   time, would anybody build a fort with so many gates and without a   water source? These regularly   spaced towers line up along a hill, separated by about 5 meters (16   feet). The towers are easily seen from Chankilloï¿½s central complex,   but the views of these towers from the eastern and western observing   points are especially illuminating. These viewpoints are situated so   that, on the winter and summer solstices, the sunrises and sunsets   line up with the towers at either end of the line. Other solar events,   such as the rising and setting of the Sun at the mid-points between   the solstices, were aligned with different towers.(3) ","(-9.189967, -75.015152)",-9.189967,-75.015152,"The Sechin complex in the Casma Valley was the capital of a pre-Incan culture located on the northwest coast of Peru, occupied between approximately 1,800-900 BC.

"Serpent Mound, USA",Serpent Mound Earhwork,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/americaserpentmound.htm,"Serpent Mound, Ohio, USA","The Serpent Mound in Ohio is the largest physical serpent effigy mound in the world. While there are several burial mounds around the Serpent mound site, the monument itself does not contain any human remains and the structure itself is therefore now primarily recognised as an astronomical observatory. The Serpent was recently named by National Geographic as one of the four ï¿½Sacred Places of the Worldï¿½ and is also a U.S. nominee to the UNESCO World Heritage sites. Of all the prehistoric American mounds that have survived the test of time, the serpent mound is one of the most intriguing.  In addition to the presence of the mound itself and the debate over the meaning of the 'egg' feature in its mouth, it was built overlooking a massive impact crater, which adds more myth than answers to the legend of the Great Serpent Mound. The Serpent varies in height from less than a foot at its spiral beginning to more than three feet at its highest points. The serpent winds back and forth for more than eight hundred feet and seven coils, and ends in a triple-coiled tail. The serpent head has an open mouth extending around the east end of a 120-foot (37 m) long hollow oval feature.This oval is said to possibly symbolize several things: A primordial egg, the sun, the body of a frog, the universe or merely the remnant of a platform. Of course, it is not conclusively known what its purpose is, but that only adds to its beautiful mystery. It is not known which culture exactly is responsible for the original construction of this magnificent Mound, but there are several clues we can use to deduce its makers. It is clear that many different cultures adapted this structure for their own needs, but who created it.?Researchers have attributed construction of the mound to three different prehistoric indigenous cultures. Although it was once thought to be Adena in origin, now based on the use of more advanced technology, including carbon dating and evidence from 1996 studies, many scholars now believe that members of the Fort Ancient culture built it about 1070 CE (plus or minus 70 years). Well known for mound building across Ohio, many Scholars believe the Fort Ancient culture created these mounds in 1070 B.C. However, this proto-historic group could have simply restored the Mounds after a prior culture may have abandoned them.The Fort Ancient culture was named for was named because they inhabited warren County Ohio, and were believed to have created the ramparts of the large notched earthworks known as Fort Ancient. After more research, it was discovered that they simply inherited Fort Ancient from the Hopewell culture at least 1000 years before the Fort Ancient culture. (7)This suggests the Hopewell culture may have in fact created Serpents mound, but more conclusive evidence is needed. 'Farmer Warren Cowen of Hilsborough, Ohio, while fox hunting recently discovered several ancient graves. They were situated upon a high point of land in Highland County, Ohio, about a mile from the famous Serpent Mound, where Prof. Putnam of Harvard made interesting discoveries. As soon as the weather permitted, Cowen excavated several of these graves. The graves were made of large limestone slabs, two and a half to three feet in length and a foot wide. These were set on edge about a foot apart. Similar slabs covered the graves. A single one somewhat larger was at the head and another at the foot. The top of the grave was two feet below the present surface. Upon opening one of the graves a skeleton of upwards of six feet was brought to light. There were a number of stone hatchets, beads, and ornaments of peculiar workmanship near the right arm. Several large flint spear and arrow heads among the ribs gave evidence that the warrior had died in battle. In another grave was the skeleton of a man equally large... Several pipes and pendants were near the shoulders. In other graves, Cowen made equally interesting finds. It seems that the region was populated by a fairly intelligent people, and that the serpent mound was an object of worship. Near the graves is a large field in which broken implements, fragments of pottery, and burned stones give evidence of a prehistoric village'. It is generally accepted today that the Serpent mound was designed to view celestial precession, one of the best places to do so is the head of the Snake. But the coils of the snake are predominantly Lunar in their orientation, capturing the full 18.6 year cycle. It is now suggested that the monuments was orientated for both Solar and Lunar observations. In 1987 Clark and Marjorie Hardman published their finding that the oval-to-head area of the serpent (facing the crater) is aligned to the summer solstice sunset (3). The head of the serpent is aligned to the summer solstice sunset and the coils also may point to the winter solstice sunrise and the equinox sunrise (4).  The body of the snake is marked by several points of reference for different celestial Phenomenon as seen by the signs below: The year the Mounds are expected to have been created was in 1070 BC, and there were two significant astronomical occurrences that may have inspired their construction: The light from a Supernova that created the Crab Nebula in 1054, and the appearance of Halleyï¿½s Comet in 1066.The light from the supernova would have been visible in the night sky and the daytime, (5) but of course there are a multitude of other celestial phenomenon that could have inspired this magnificent Ancient Effigy.Another common cosmic theme is that Serpents mound is aligned to Draco. Draco is a featured constellation in a plethora of other cultures, and the harmony is definitely seen at Serpents mound.The pattern of Stars in the constellation Draco fits precisely to the Mound, with the ancient Pole Star, Thuban at its geographical centre within the first of seven coils from the head. The Great Serpent mound is placed on a plateau overlooking a unique 5-mile diameter circular ""cryptoexplosion"" area with its own gravity and faulted and folded bedrock. Since there are no volcanoes in the region, it is generally accepted to have been caused by a cosmic encounter. So great was the impact that scientific instruments have measured gravitational and magnetic anomalies at Serpent Mound which show that the natural forces in the area deviate because of the subsurface disruption. (2) A press release on December 16th2003 stated geologists from Ohio State government and the University of Glasgow (Scotland) concluded that a meteorite strike was responsible for the formation. They became convinced of the meteorite theory after studying deep rock and mineral core samples collected at the site in the 1970s. Further analyses of the rock core samples recovered at the site indicated the meteorite impact occurred during the Permian Period, about 248 to 286 million years ago. During that period, geologists believe the modern-day continents were fused together into a single super-continent called Pangaea, and the area of present-day Ohio lay just south of the equator.[8]This location is one of the few places in North America where such an occurrence is seen. Of course, there is speculation that whoever built these mounds did so purposely to correlate to the impact zone, while others believe there is no coincidence. ""The people who have looked at the samples are sure. It's one of the most mysterious places in North America. The Native Americans found something mystical there. And they were right.""-Raymond R. Anderson of the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (2) The journey along the Serpent mound begins at the tail. When you approach the mounds, the first thing that you witness is a perfect spiral. This spiral feature is a well noted phenomenon around the ancient world. There are several good examples in the America's, most notably those atNazcaandChaco Canyon. Although the original significance  of the spiral and labyrinthine form are lost to us now, they are commonly suggested to be related to the 'inner journey'. '...the belly and navel (Neumann 1955). It is also seen as representing a Navel of the earth - the Omphalos...E.A.S Butterworth in 'The Tree at the Navel of the Earth' calls it the Omphalos sign...now seen as very ancient and very widespread (Roscher 1913), This fits well into the idea of megalith as places of interchange between the cosmic forces of the sky and earth'. 10 Walking from the Spiral along the serpent body is a peaceful and contemplative experience. The farther you walk along the Serpent, the more astronomical observatories you encounter. The undulations of the serpents body were designed to be orientated such that they align with the most significant moments of the Lunar and Solar calendars on both sides: While today many of these alignments are obscured by trees, in its original form and with the lines of sight cleared, the monument would have once been able to operate as a calendar for both cycles (Metonic).The Snakes head: Some say the serpent has an 'egg' in its mouth, while others say it is 'Eating the Sun'.The head is aligned to the summer solstice sunset, and acts as a wonderful observatory to view the solar precession. Facing away from the Cosmic egg and Serpent head, there is a platform that provides the most breathtaking view of the Impact area below. It seems likely that both the location of the mound and its design (the 'egg' it carries in its mouth), are both connected in some intricate way to the crater over which it lies coiled. The Serpent Mound Tunnels:If you ever go to serpents mound, a short walk along the trails leading away from the mounds will take you directly under the rock face of the mounds. Walking along the path below the mounds and deep into the sides of the bedrock, are numerous small ""tunnels"" into the rock. Some of the holes go into the bedrock very deep. Itï¿½s unknown how these holes were made, although it is loosely suggested that they originated from a prehistoric underground gas explosion. It is entertaining to think that they might have been associated in some way with snakes.

"Shanidar Cave, Iraq",Neanderthal to Present,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/iraqshanidar.htm,"Shanidar Cave, Iraq","Several isolated finds of copper objects have been discovered from before the 6th Millennia B.C. The earliest artefact of pure copper known to me is a 2.3 cm pendant found in the Shanidar Cave located in north-east Iraq that is dated to 9,500 B.C. (Hummel 2004). The first excavations produced nine skeletons of Neanderthals of varying ages (labelled Shanidar I - IX). A tenth was recently discovered by the Smithsonian institute. The burials have led to the realisation that at this early time burials were accompanied by funeral ceremonies involving flowers. Shanidar I was an elderly Neanderthal male known as 'Nandy' to its excavators. He was 40-45 years old and displayed signs of deformity and trauma. At different times of his life he had suffered violent blows and congenital childhood diseases all of which show care and healing long before his death indicating care amongst groups of Humanoids at this early time. Shanidar II was an adult male who evidently died in a rock-fall inside the cave. There is evidence of a ritual send-off found on top of his grave.

This skeleton of a male between 35-40 years old was found in a foetal position. Soil samples from the site showed the presence of large amounts of flowers over the burial.

"Silbury Hill, England",Largest European Pyramid,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandsilburyhill.htm,"Silbury Hill, England","Conical in shape, and rising to a height of 130 ft, with a circular base more than 200 yards in diameter and a flattened top. Its total volume has been estimated at 400,000 cubic feet. Excavations at the top and sides have revealed no skeletal or funerary remains. There are indications that a large pole may have once topped the hill.(1) Silbury Hill is a part of the complex of Neolithic monuments aroundAveburyin Wiltshire (which   also includes   theWest Kennetlong barrow and theSanctuary). It reveals an immense technical skill and   a prolonged control over labour and resources. Archaeologists calculate that   Silbury Hill took 18 million   man-hours to dump and shape 248,000 cubic metres (8.75 million cubic ft) of   earth on top of a natural hill.The   base of the monument is 167m (550ft) in diameter and it is perfectly   round. Its summit is flat-topped and 30m (100ft) wide (The same as the Sarsen circle at Stonehenge). The area   immediately surrounding the monument is lower than the level of the land   around it. The presence of natural springs offers the suggestion that in   the past the lowered area may have been filled in with water on occasioncreating a 'moat' effect similar to that once surroundingGlastonbury Tor. Extract From British Archaeology, Issue 70, 2003 - 'Archaeologists have come to see that ditches, even massive   ditches around henges or hillforts, need not always be just utilitarian   structures but may have had a metaphysical function too - for example, to   keep evil spirits at bay. The rectangular extension at Silbury, if   water-filled, would have served as a cistern or reservoir. Elsewhere in   the world, cisterns have often been the focus of ritual and ceremony. The   mirror-like quality of standing water may have had symbolic implications   too. For just three days in early summer   2001, as the water-filled ditch dried out, a huge vegetation mark,   straight-edged and some 10m wide, appeared to extend across the ditch   floor for some 50m towards the mound. Its orientation, however, was   curious, running diagonally across the ditch extension towards a   position off-centre of the mound. The feature definitely seems   man-made. It may be that the hill's Neolithic builders dug a deeper   channel here to collect water from local springs and bring it to the   deep ditch encircling the mound. It seems likely, then, that Silbury   Hill's ditches were intentionally filled with water. Furthermore, the   hill itself was built next to water, close to the River Kennet. The   siting of this monumental mound in a valley - so that its summit   barely attains the level of the surrounding hilltops - has often   raised comment. Why not build higher up? The answer must be that the   place itself was as important as the mound.' (4) Being the largest   prehistoric mound of its kind in Europe, we can assume that the   construction of this hill was one of the most important   undertakings of its time but we are often reminded that there have   been no discoveries of funerary remains, chambers or any other   evidence that might explain its construction so how are we to   explain the presence of this monumental structure? Geographically,   the mound sits in dip in the landscape, almost disguised by the   surrounding folds in the hills, yet its specific location must   have been an important consideration so it is likely for some   reason that this was a deliberate choice. At the same time, we are   reminded that the hill would have originally been white from the   chalk which would have made the hill shine like a beacon to those   who could see her. A White covering is also suspected on the three   henges at theThornborough   Complexin Yorkshire suggestive of a ceremonial function. The large conical mounds found across UK have been suggested as representing the 'Primal Mound'. The concept of the primal mound is related to creation myths concerning the origin of mankind itself. Several other cultures such as Egyptian, Indian and Sumerian have references to 'Primal mounds' which were all said to have emerged from the watery chaos of the 'First time'. In the Egyptian mythology,Atumwas considered both the creator and the destroyer and the primal mound itself, represented by the 'Ben-ben' and later through Obelisks and Pyramids. The most significant 'Primal' mounds in Uk - such as Silbury, Glastonbury and Maes Howe all share an association with water. It is now a common belief that Silbury Hill was built deliberately so as to be permanently surrounded by water. Similarly, Glastonbury was surrounded by water when it was first in use during the Neolithic. The Passage mound of Maes Hill offers another interesting aspect of these purported mounds which is that they are commonly associated with one or two prominent nearby stone circles. Examples of this includeNewgrange(surrounded by a stone circle),Gavr'inisin France (With the twin circles ofEr-Lannicdirectly in front), andGgantijaon the island of Gozo (Malta). Silbury Hill lies directly south ofAvebury, and less than a kilometre away. The main advocate of this theory is Michael Dames, who wrote in the 70's of his theory that Silbury hill was constructed to represent the pregnant figure of the Earth-mother itself. Dames became aware that the outline formed by the moat surrounding Silbury resembled other prehistoric images of the Earth-mother. In order to support his claim, Dames presented evidence of other examples of Earth-mother profiles in ancient construction. In particular he mentions both the Maltese temples and the dwellings on the Orkneys, which have been noted for their anthropomorphic outlines. Perhaps even more significant is that recent discoveries have revealed that dwellings near Silbury were shaped anthropomorphically too. Silbury Hill was built on a latitude with a geometric significance, as were several other prominent prehistoric structures. In Egypt, it is now realised that the temple complexes were located according to 'geodetic' principles, an it appears that the same can be said of many of the European megalithic complexes. Both Karnak (Thebes) and Giza/Heliopolis in Egypt were located on  latitudes which can be shown to have a geometric foundation. If one divides the northern hemisphere into seven equal units (i.e. 90 In addition,  the same geometry can be seen in the exterior angles of the pyramids of Giza. For example, the latitude of Silbury hill is mirrored in the exterior angle of Menkaures pyramid, and it is perhaps no coincidence that the exterior angle of Silbury hill is the same as the latitude of Giza. At present, such information is brushed off by most researchers as pure coincidence, but it is possible to see an extension of this geometry in the other Giza pyramids, and at other significant prehistoric locations. Silbury hill is   just one in a line of natural and artificial mounds along the St.   Michael's ley, which itself has a strong association with   astronomy. The tradition of burning beacons on hill tops to mark particular days is well understood in England and there are numerous examples of 'Beacon hills' and artificially flatten hill-tops reminding us that the practice was important in connecting both the landscape and the people together with solar and lunar cycles.  Although we are   left with no clear idea as to the original purpose of Silbury, we do know that   it was builtafterother sites in the area such as Avebury   and West-Kennet which could mean that it was built simply to reinforce   the sanctity of the area so that while there is no questioning its   importance in the prehistoric landscape, the debate over its   actualfunctionwill have to remain academic until our   understanding of the Neolithic mind improves. Silbury hill is estimated to have been constructed around 2,600 - 2,400 BC. It is now suggestedthat the construction took two phases: soon after work was started, a re-design was ordered, and the mound enlarged. It is constructed in steps, each step being filled in with packed chalk, and then smoothed off. Two small trenches cut on the summit revealed a fragment of antler from a secure context, lying against a chalk wall in a deposit of chalk rubble. This produced a secure radiocarbon date of between 2490-2340 BC, placing the mound firmly in the Late Neolithic(4). There have been three major excavations of the mound: the first when a team of Cornish miners led by the Duke of Northumberland sunk a shaft from top to bottom in 1776, another in 1849 when a tunnel was dug from the edge into the centre, and a third in 1968-70 when professor Richard Atkinson had another tunnel cut into the base. Nothing of any significance has ever been found on Silbury Hill: at its core there is only clay, flints, turf, moss, topsoil, gravel, freshwater shells, mistletoe, oak, hazel, sarsen stones, ox bones, and antler tines. In 1969 Prof. Richard Atkinson attracted a great deal of interest as he attempted to reveal the secrets of Silbury Hill near Marlborough. Such was his enthusiasm, he even agreed to the BBC showing the dig on TV! The BBC were present at Silbury for three seasons. The cause of the hole was determined to be a collapse from the unsatisfactory back-fill from earlier excavations. It was decided to enter the tunnel dug by a team of archaeologists in 1968 and back-fill it with chalk, also filling in the voids created during the various excavations of the mound since the 1776 tomb-raiding exploits of the Duke of Northumberland. A seismic survey was commissioned by National Heritage in February 2002. it showed that the hill was stable, and unlikely to suffer any further serious collapse. It also showed that before it was covered over and smoothed, it had been built in the shape of a spiral, probably to assist in the construction process. This same design has recently been determined to have been used to construct the Great pyramid of Giza. (Ref: English Heritage)   According to legend, this is the last resting place of King Sil. Another legend states that the mound   holds a life-size solid gold statue of King Sil and yet a third, that the   Devil was carrying an apron of soil to drop on the citizens of   Marlborough, but he was stopped by the priests of nearby Avebury. The suggestion that a pole may have once topped the hill, is an indication that the site could have served as a means of determining the time of year (i.e. by the shadow cast), a similar theory to that proposed for thepyramidsof Egypt by Davidson (2).    ","(51.4157321, -1.8574235)",51.4157321,-1.8574235,"There are indications that a large pole may have once topped the hill.(1) Silbury Hill is a part of the complex of Neolithic monuments aroundAveburyin Wiltshire (which   also includes   theWest Kennetlong barrow and theSanctuary).
Archaeologists calculate that   Silbury Hill took 18 million   man-hours to dump and shape 248,000 cubic metres (8.75 million cubic ft) of   earth on top of a natural hill.The   base of the monument is 167m (550ft) in diameter and it is perfectly   round.
The presence of natural springs offers the suggestion that in   the past the lowered area may have been filled in with water on occasioncreating a 'moat' effect similar to that once surroundingGlastonbury Tor. Extract From British Archaeology, Issue 70, 2003 - 'Archaeologists have come to see that ditches, even massive   ditches around henges or hillforts, need not always be just utilitarian   structures but may have had a metaphysical function too - for example, to   keep evil spirits at bay.
The rectangular extension at Silbury, if   water-filled, would have served as a cistern or reservoir.
For just three days in early summer   2001, as the water-filled ditch dried out, a huge vegetation mark,   straight-edged and some 10m wide, appeared to extend across the ditch   floor for some 50m towards the mound.
It may be that the hill's Neolithic builders dug a deeper   channel here to collect water from local springs and bring it to the   deep ditch encircling the mound.
It seems likely, then, that Silbury   Hill's ditches were intentionally filled with water.
The answer must be that the   place itself was as important as the mound.' (4) Being the largest   prehistoric mound of its kind in Europe, we can assume that the   construction of this hill was one of the most important   undertakings of its time but we are often reminded that there have   been no discoveries of funerary remains, chambers or any other   evidence that might explain its construction so how are we to   explain the presence of this monumental structure?
Geographically,   the mound sits in dip in the landscape, almost disguised by the   surrounding folds in the hills, yet its specific location must   have been an important consideration so it is likely for some   reason that this was a deliberate choice.
The most significant 'Primal' mounds in Uk - such as Silbury, Glastonbury and Maes Howe all share an association with water.
It is now a common belief that Silbury Hill was built deliberately so as to be permanently surrounded by water.
The main advocate of this theory is Michael Dames, who wrote in the 70's of his theory that Silbury hill was constructed to represent the pregnant figure of the Earth-mother itself.

"Sphinx, Egypt",Watcher of the Rising sun,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/egyptsphinx.htm,"The Sphinx, Egypt","The Giza Sphinx was carved from the living rock and faces directly east. It has become an symbol of mystery and is now believed to have been one of the first structures at Ghiza. The Sphinx of Giza has watched the rising sun for thousands of years, it's position on the Giza plateau has earned it a special place in our  hearts and minds, as it's origin and meaning have become lost to us.  The Sphinx of Giza has watched the rising sun for thousands of years, it's position on the Giza plateau has earned it a special place in our  hearts and minds, as it's origin and meaning have become lost to us. The head-dress, beard and  Cobra on the   forehead are traditionally associated with royalty. Sir Norman Lockyer suggested that the image of a half lion, half woman aspect symbolised the junctions of the constellations Leo and Virgo which occurred at a summer solstice in the fourth millennium BC.(2) As Dr. Selim Hassan(6),  stated in his report regarding his excavation of the Sphinx enclosure of the 1940s: Taking all things into   consideration, it seems that we must give the credit of erecting this,   the worldï¿½s most wonderful statue, to Khafre, but always with this   reservation that there is not one single contemporary inscription   which connects the Sphinx with Khafre, so sound as it may appear, we   must treat the evidence as circumstantial, until such time as a lucky   turn of the spade of the excavator will reveal to the world a definite   reference to the erection of the Sphinx.  The 'Inventory stella'- Found at Ghiza by Auguste Mariette in the 1850's, in the ruins of the Temple of Isis clearly states thatKhufurestored the Sphinx. This stone provides some of the strongest evidence that the Sphinx was constructedbeforeKhufuand not by him. It says: 'The Sphinx stela shows, in line thirteen, the   cartouche of Khephren. I believe that to indicate an excavation   carried out by that prince, following which, thealmost certain proofthat the Sphinx was already buried in sand by the time of Khafre and his predecessors'. Evidence for Thutmosis IV's campaign   is preserved in the so-called dream Stele he erected between the two   paws of the Sphinx in ca. 1400 BC. According to the story inscribed in   the Stella, the Sphinx spoke to him in a dream and asked the prince to   free him from the sand. The Sphinx (Hor-em-Akht) offered in return the   crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. It is often quoted as associating    the sphinx with Khafre. When the Dream stele   was discovered, however, the lines of text were incomplete, only   referring to a ï¿½Khaf,ï¿½ and not the full ï¿½Khafra.ï¿½ The missing syllable   ï¿½raï¿½ was later added to complete the translation by Thomas Young, on   the assumption that the text referred to ï¿½Khafra.ï¿½ Youngï¿½s   interpretation was based on an earlier facsimile in which the   translation reads as follows:  Comment-  Apart from the above testimonies, there is no contemporary record of the construction of the sphinx (or the   main three Ghiza pyramids), which  seems to elude a historical context. It   is noted that the sphinx is linked via a causeway, to the pyramid ofKhafre, notKhufu. Following a detailed examination of the erosion   features on the walls of the Sphinx enclosure, Dr Robert Schoch, together   with other geologists and geophysicists, concluded that the Sphinx had   been weathered mainly by rainfallbeforethe Sahara became a   desert, and must therefore be around 7,000 - 9,000 years old. (1) Schoch argued that   because the Nile valley experienced the 'Nabtian Fluvial' from 10,000 to   3,000 B.C., that it must have been in this time that the deep fissures in   the sphinx enclosure were made. Schoch and a colleague also took seismic   readings to determine sub-surface water penetration in the bedrock of the   Sphinx. 'They found that   their seismic readings showed sub-surface water penetration at six to   eight feet deep in the front half, and four feet at the rear. This   differential could only be explained by presuming that the Sphinx had been   carved in different stages; the head and the forepart first, and the   hindquarters last. It is known that the Sphinx has been renovated at least   three times in history, and they argue that the rear part was carved by   Khafre (Chephren), which accounts for the tradition linking Khafre with   the Sphinx'. (1)   Smyth(12), noted that   the ï¿½red colour was still visible on its cheeksï¿½, and that fragments of ï¿½a   colossal stone beardï¿½ were discovered in 1817, upon which it was noted   that ï¿½all the internal joining surfaces of the blocks had been figured   full of the idol gods of the most profane and Cainite Egyptï¿½. Former director of the German Institute of Archaeology in Cairo, Rainer   Stadelmann, suggested it was Khufu, and not his son Khafra, who was   responsible for constructing the monument. Stadelmann bases his ideas on   the distinct iconography of the headdress and missing, collapsed, beard   (the remains are housed in the Cairo museum), which he argued is more   indicative of the style of Khufu than Khafra. He supports this by   suggesting that Khafraï¿½s causeway was built to conform to a pre-existing   structure, which he concludes, given its location, could only have been   the Sphinx. The word ""Sphinx"" comes from the   GreekΣφιγξï¿½Sphingx, apparently from   the verbσφιγγωï¿½sphinggo, meaning   ""to strangle"" (note that the γ takes on a 'ng' sound in front of   both γ and ξ). This may be a name derived from the fact that the   hunters for a pride are the lionesses and they kill their prey by   strangulation, biting the throat of prey and holding them down   until they die. The word ""Sphincter"" derives from the same root.  Greek Sphinx's: The historians and geographers of Greece wrote extensively about the Egyptian culture and their writings were circulated widely with Greek and Roman culture. They sometimes called the ram-headed sphinxes,criosphinxesand the bird-headed ones,hierocosphinxes. There was a singleSphinxin Greek mythology, a unique demon of destruction and bad luck. According to Hesiod she was a daughter of Echidna and Orthrus or, according to others, a daughter of Echidna and Typhon. All of these are figures from the earliest of Greek myths, before the Olympians ruled the Greek pantheon. The Greek sphinx was represented in vase-painting and bas-reliefs most often seated upright rather than recumbent, as a winged lion with a woman's head; or she was a woman with the paws, claws and breasts of a lion, a serpents tail and eagles wings. She is said to have guarded the   entrance to a certain area, often the Greek city of Thebes, and to   have asked a riddle of travellers to obtain passage. The exact   riddle asked by the Sphinx was not specified by early tellers of   the stories about the sphinx, and was not standardized as the one   given below until late in Greek history. It was said in late lore thatHeraorAiressent the Sphinx from her Ethiopian   homeland (the Greeks always remembered the foreign origin of the   Sphinx) to Thebes in Greece where, in the writings of Sophoclese,   Oedipus Tyrannus, she asks all passers by history's most famous   riddle: ""Which creature in the     morning goes on four feet, at noon on two, and in the evening     upon three?"" She strangled and devoured anyone unable to answer.     Oedipus solved the riddle: answering, Manï¿½who crawls on all     fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and walks     with a cane in old age. Bested at last, the tale   continues, the Sphinx then threw herself from her high rock and   died. An alternative version tells that she devoured herself. Thus   Oedipus can be recognized as a ""threshold"" figure, helping effect   the transition between the old religious practices, represented by   the death of the Sphinx, and the rise of the new, Olympian   deities.   Mesopotamian sphinx's:The following images are both from Anatolia, or modern-day Turkey. Boghazkoy was the capital of the Hittite empire in the second millennium BC and the sphinx gateway at Alacahuyuk was the primary entrance to another Hittite city, Alacahuyuk which dates back to 4,000 BC. Asian Sphinx's: In contrast to the sphinx in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece, where the traditions largely have been lost due to the discontinuity of the civilization, the traditions of the ""Asian sphinx"" are very much alive today. The earliest artistic depictions of ""sphinxes"" from the South Asian subcontinent are to some extent influenced by Hellenistic art and writings. These hail from the period when Buddhist art underwent a phase of Hellenistic influence. But the ""sphinxes"" from Mathura, Kausambi, and Sanchi, dated to the third century BC until the first century AD, also show a considerable non-Hellenist, indigenous character. It is not possible, therefore, to conclude the concept of the ""sphinx"" originated through foreign influence. In South India the ""sphinx"" is known aspurushamriga(Sanskrit) orpurushamirukam(Tamil), meaning ""human-beast"". It is found depicted in sculptural art in temples and palaces where it serves an apotropaic purpose, just as the ""sphinxes"" in other parts of the ancient world. It is said by the tradition, to take away the sins of the devotees when they enter a temple and to ward off evil in general. It is therefore often found in a strategic position on the gopuram or temple gateway, or near the entrance of the Sanctum Sanctorium. S. American Sphinx's- 'In the south-east corner of Vera Cruz, the state where the largest of theNegroid colossiwere found, archaeologists have turned up an Egyptian bas-relief carving of a Semite on the back of a Totonac slate mirror. In Monte Alban itself, where the Negroid dancers or death figures were engraved, carvings closely resembling anEgyptian Sphinxand the Egyptian god Ra, in its bird aspect, appear at the same location. Furthermore, when we move with the wave of the Olmec culture sweeping slowly down through the narrow corridor of land that joins the two Americas, linking Mexico in the north with the world of Peru in the south, we come upon the most concrete evidence of an Egyptian presence'.

"Stonehenge, England",Henge-Circle,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandstonehenge.htm,"Stonehenge, England","The monument we see today is the result of several different construction phases with the same area having been used long before Stonehenge itself existed as testified by the adjacentCursusand large post-holes, both dated from well before any of the acknowledged construction phases. The 'Avenue'-The outermost element of the site is the 'Avenue' that runs away from the site down a gentle slope for 530m into Stonehenge Bottom (and the River Avon). The Avenue consists of twin banks about 12m (40ft) apart with internal ditches which begin at the entrance to the earthwork enclosure and terminate at the River Avon. The Stonehenge end of the avenue is aligned to the summer solstice sunrise, with the other end terminating at another henge/circle by the River Avon. It has been recently realised (2009), that the other end of the 'Avenue' also once had a henge-circle at its terminus. This newly discovered part of the Stonehenge landscape has been dubbed 'Bluestonehenge', due to the fact that it was formed of 24/25 'Bluestone' menhirs, currently thought to have been later moved to Stonehenge during the second phase of construction. The discovery another such monument on the supports the idea of an intimate connection between the megliths, the landscape, the visible heavens and the after-life.  The Heel-Stone -(See Photo, right) - At 20ft long (4ft underground), around 8ft wide by 7ft thick(3), this stone is a classic example of anoutlier, standing at the entrance to the earthworks, and in line with 'The Avenue'.  The 'Heel-stone' is a large upright, un-worked sarsen (hard sandstone) which lies immediately adjacent to the A344 road. The nearest source of stones of the size represented by the large sarsens at Stonehenge is on the Marlborough Downs, nearAvebury, about 30km to the NE. Extract from Burl -'The heel-stone is popularly thought to stand in line with the midsummer sunrise but it does not and never did... Astronomical analysis has shown instead that the stone is in-line with rising of the moon halfway between its northern minor and major positions'(11). The 'Heel-stone is thought by some to be one of an originalfourstones that once stood at the entrance to the henge. In 1620, Inigo Jones sketched the proposed sarsens in-situ. (see diagram, left).  The Slaughter Stone -This stone is about 21-ft long, un-worked. Although it was originally upright, it is now fallen and has now sunk so deep that only its upper face shows. It is believed that it is one of a pair of 'portal' stones that would have marked the entrance to the circle from the earliest phase of building.  The Ditch and BankorThe 'Henge' -(Stonehenge I): Moving inwards from the Heel Stone is a large earthwork enclosure that consists of a ditch and an interior bank, the original height of which was calculated by Professor Atkinson as being about 1.8m (6ft). The Station Stones- Also a part of  the first design, and originally four upright-stones, the 'Station-stones form a quadrangle in the inner edge of the earthwork bank. Apart from sharing the same orientation as the 'Avenue', the specific significance of these stones has defied any traditional explanation by archaeologists in the past as they are unique in British prehistoric architecture.   The Aubrey Holes-(Recently assigned a C14 date of 3,000 BC- 2,300 BC)(15). Immediately adjacent to the bank is a ring of 56 pits, known as the Aubrey Holes, marked by circular concrete spots. The Aubrey holes were suggested by Prof. G. Hawkins It is now well known that the simplest means of modelling the movements of the Sun and Moon (Tides) is with a circle of 28 markers around a central earth. Moving a 'Moon-marker' one position per day and a 'Sun-marker' once every 13 days, provides a calendar accurate to 98%. By doubling the sun-moon calendar to 56 markers, one can obtain an accuracy of 99.8%, with the additional  benefit of being able to predict eclipses to high accuracy.(17) The combination of astronomically relevant orientations and means of accurate calculating both solar and lunar cycles with the same 'monument/device' offers the clear possibility that the (original) builders were already aware of 'Metonic' cycle, whereby both the cycles of the sun and moon synchronise over a period of 18.6 solar yearsor235 lunations with an error of only 2 hours. The Y and Z holes- Almost every one of the 59, Y and Z holes had fragments of bluestone in them.  The Sarsen Stones -In its hypothetical complete form the outermost stone setting would have consisted of a circle of 30 upright sarsens, of which 17 still stand today, each weighing around 25 tons. The tops of these uprights were linked by a continuous ring of another 30 horizontal sarsen lintels, only a small part of which is now still in position. The stones in the sarsen circle were carefully shaped and the horizontal lintels were joined not only by means of mortise-and-tenon joints, but were also locked using what is effectively a dovetail joint. The edges were smoothed into a gentle curve which follows the line of the entire circle. In the late 19th century Wiliam Petrie Flinders suggested that the stone circle was never completed and left open to the south west. He cited as evidence 'the small, half size sarsen, Stone 11, and Stones 21, 23 being defective in size compared to the other sarsens'. The evidence from the recentlaser survey of Stonehengesupports this early conclusion, suggesting that the monument was actually constructed as a large arc in a similar fashion to the arrangement of the bluestones in theQ&R Holes. All that was needed at the south west sector was Stone 16 to mark the axis. Furthermore, 'groundscans and probing have failed to reveal sockets for the missing south-west sector sarsens, providing no evidence for continuation of the sarsen circle from stone 14 to 20 in the north-west, with the exception of the monolith (16) marking the axis'.(23)  'The laser-scan survey carried out in March last year forEnglish Heritageby theGreenhatch Group, revealed 72 previously unknown axe and dagger carvings etched into the faces of five of the giant sarsen megaliths, trebling the number of carvings known at Stonehenge. Prior to this laser survey, 44 prehistoric carvings had been identified at Stonehenge on Stones 3, 4, 5, and 53 commencing with Richard Atkinson's discovery of a number of Bronze Age carvings in 1953(23). Flinders Petrie calculated the diameter at 1167.9 (+/- 0.7 British inches) (13), which works out at 1166.6 Primitive inches (giving a circumference of 3663.1 primitive inches), which although still accurate to within .03%, is not as exact as Le Mesurier suggested.   The Sarsen Horseshoe -  The Bluestones- The significance of the 'Bluestone' is not yet fully understood. Heath suggested that the location of the quarry was determined through a geometric or geodetic p Although it has been suggested recently that the Bluestones were 'Glacial Erratics', and were therefore  not  transported  by hand, there are two specific evidences which suggest otherwise: Firstly, there have been no other discoveries of 'Erratic' bluestones in the area, and  secondly, the quarry in Preseli from which the stones originated, still show remains of unfinished blocks and several Neolithic engravings. 'There were also a small number of limestone blocks and slabs used in the construction of Stonehenge brought to the site for the specific purpose of packing material to support the much larger sarsen uprights. The limestone quarries have been identified as Chilmark, 12 miles west, and 3 miles southeast at Hurdcot'.(19) This debate has now been put to rest by the official discovery in 2011 of the source of the first stones used at Stonehenge. The exact location has now been determined to be a 70m outcrop called Craig Rhos-y-Felin in northern Pembrokeshire.(Quick-link) Wiltshire archaeologist J F S Stone in 1947, excavated an area near the Cursus and discovered a scatter of bluestone fragments with a marked concentration near the Cursus itself, and in 2006 a sizeable fragment of The Altar Stone -Lying in the geometric centre of the monument is a worked recumbent megalith.It was most recently excavated in the 1950s, but no written records of the excavation survive. The Alter Stone measures 16 feet long, 1 foot 9 inches deep and 3 feet 4 inches wide.Hawkins(3)makes note that while all the other stones were either bluestone or sarsen, the so called altar-stone is 'of fine-grained pale green sandstone, containing so many flakes of mica that its surface, wherever freshly exposed, shows the typical mica glitter'. The stone when standing would have reflected the sunlight enhancing the effect of the summer solstice sunrise. This stone seems to have come from the Cosheston Beds, composed of old red sandstone, at Milford haven on the coast of Wales, some 30miles to the southwest of the Prescilly quarries and is another example of the specific selection of stones by the builders of the European megaliths. Pre-Stonehenge: Archaeologists have found four, or possibly five, large Mesolithic postholes  (one may have been a natural tree throw), which date to around 8,000 BC, beneath the nearby modern tourist car-park. These held pine posts around 0.75 metres (2 ft 6 in) in diameter which were erected and eventually rottedin situ. Three of the posts (and possibly four) were in an east-west alignment which may have had ritual significance; no parallels are known from Britain at the time but similar sites have been found in Scandinavia. Salisbury was then still wooded but 4,000 years later, during the earlier Neolithic, people built a causewayed enclosure at Robin Hood's Ball and long-barrow tombs in the surrounding landscape. In approximately 3500 BC, a Stonehenge Cursus was built 700 metres (2,300 ft) north of the site as the first farmers began to clear the trees and develop the area. Aubrey Burl had the following to say on the matter: 'When  the car park was extended in 1966 three, large and deep postholes were noticed about 250 metres north-west of the circle. Their positions are marked by white rings today (now concrete posts). They had held tall posts and aroused much enthusiasm. The late Peter Newham, author of an excellent, highly regarded booklet on the astronomy of Stonehenge, wrote, 'These can be regarded as the most positive ""astronomical"" discovery yet made at Stonehenge ... they align on sun and moon setting positions with an extreme accuracy' ... 'The solution lies in the unpublished Carbon-14 dates for the Stonehenge postholes. One was for 6,140 BC (uncorrected), and the other for 7,180 BC (uncorrected), long before Stonehenge ... If the posts near Stonehenge were Mesolithic, erected several thousands of years before the Henge, thentheir extreme astronomical accuracy was entirely accidental'.(1) 'An excavation funded with redundancy money shows Stonehenge was a settlement 3,000 years before it was built. The archaeological dig, a mile from the stones, has revealed that people have occupied the area since 7,500BC. The findings, uncovered by volunteers on a shoestring budget, are 5,000 years earlier than previously thought. Dr Josh Pollard, from Southampton University, said the team had ""found the community who put the first monument up at Stonehenge"". Over the past seven years, the site has yielded the earliest semi-permanent settlement in the Stonehenge area from 7,500 to 4,700BC. And carbon dating of material found at the site show people were there during every millennium in between'.  The Stonehenge Cursus- Before the creation of the Stonehenge monument, the landscape would have been dominated by the nearby'major' cursus, which is over a mile long and is orientated towards Wood-henge. This cursus was recently radio-carbon-dated at (c. 3,500 BC(8)),(c.3,630 and 3,375 BC(21)) and can indications from this cursus and others suggest that they can be regarded as  precursors in the evolution towards the circular design of henges and stone-circles that became the fashion in Britain following a short period of cursus construction c. 3,500-3,000 BC. The same evolution in design (from elongated cursus to circular henges) can also be seen atThornboroughin Northern England. Stonehenge 1-(3,200 BC)(11): Construction of the circular bank and ditch'The Henge', the 56 Aubrey Holes, and the 'Station stones'. (At this stage, the elements of Stonehenge indicate a lunar observation). Recent discoveries by theStonehenge Riverside Projecthave produced radiocarbon dates from cremations within the area bounded by the henge monument. The earliest, 3030-2880 BC, comes from a cremation of an adult within one of the Aubrey Holes. The most recent dates to between 2570 and 2340 BC. It was the remains of a woman in her mid twenties buried in the northern ditch. In all, around 240 people were buried within the henge. Stonehenge II-(c. 3,000 BC): Widening of the old ditch-bank(3)with pottery, animal bones, and cremated human remains placed back in the ditch; cremations also deposited in some of the partially filled Aubrey Holes and a complex of posts in the interior and in the entrance causeway. The major structural addition  Stonehenge III- Article: Antiquity (Volume 81 No. 313 September 2007), by Mike Parker Pearsonet alentitled ï¿½The age of Stonehengeï¿½. It is a summary of progress so far on theStonehenge Riverside Projectand theBeaker isotope project, and contains some interesting and important revelations about the Stonehenge and its landscape. It is now thought that the trilithon's were erected notcirca2,300 BCE, but between 2,600-2,400 BCE, making them contemporary with Durrington Walls. They now predate the earliest Beaker burials in Britain, shaking our understanding of the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age.... However, the date for the erection of the bluestones at Stonehenge has since been revised, as pointed out in the book Hengeworld by Mike Pitts, (0-09-927875-8), on page 341 he states that the ""large sarsen structures"" of Stonehenge have been dated with 95% confidence to between 2461 & 2205 bce., at the inside more than 600 years earlier .. It also seems to place these carvings well after the bluestone circle & oval, said to date from between 2267 & 1983 bce. (page 342). Early mention of Stonehenge was made in 1135 by chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth, who claimed that it was brought by a tribe of giants from Africa to Ireland, and from thereflownby the wizard Merlin across the sea. Another legend claims that the stones were stolen from an Irish woman by the Devil, and re-erected on Salisbury Plain by Merlin for Ambrosius Aurelianus, the King of Britons. Diodorus Siculuswrote in 50 BC- '...The moon when viewed from this island appears to be but a little distance from the Earth. The account is given also that the god visits the island every 19 yrs, the period in which the return of the stars to the same place in the heavens is accomplished. There is also in the island both a magnificent sacred fane of Apollo, and a notable temple...'(14) The Latitude of Stonehenge: Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, is  the location of  the  site itself which happens to be on the exact latitude so as to encompass several important astronomical observations from the same location. Indeed, the earliest evidence of construction at Stonehenge are the 'car-park post-holes', which are accurately aligned east-west, and can therefore be considered likely astronomical in nature. There are only two latitudes in the world it which, the full moon passes directly overhead on its maximum Zeniths, these are at Stonehenge andAlmendresin Portugal (The oldest circle in Western-Europe).  The Design of Stonehenge: In addition to having been built on a particularly significant latitude, the layout of the site also incorporates several other intrinsic astronomical features. In particular, from the earliest phase of  construction (c. 3,200-3,000 BC). With regard to the astronomical significance of the ï¿½Station stones,ï¿½ the lines joining 91 (east-south-east) to 92 (south-south-east) and 93 (west-north-west) to 94 (north-north-west) are parallel to the axis of the monument.  They point to mid-summer sunrise in one direction, to the North-East, and to mid-winter sunset in the opposite direction, to the South-West.  In addition, the diagonal line joining 93 to 91 points to the position where the sun rose, in ancient times, on November 8th and February 4th. Looking in the opposite direction, 91 to 93, the line points to sunset on May 6th and August 8th.  These four dates were ï¿½the four great festivals of the Druids,ï¿½ and represented important turning points in the seasons. In 1965, with the use of computers, Steven Hawkins proposed with regards to the the specific alignments to the Sun and the Moon, that it was "".....less than one chance in ten thousand that the stones had been aligned by accident"" (Hawkins 1965, p-136).  Two previously undiscovered pits have been found in the Stonehenge Cursus which point to it once being used as a place of sun worship long before the stones were erected. The pits are positioned in such a way that when viewed from the 'Heel-Stone' at Stonehenge, they would have marked the rising and setting positions of the sun on the summers solstice. (20) According to Peter Le Mesurier, the Sarsen-ring (whose official inner diameter is 97ft or 1162.8 primitive inches), has a circumference of 3652.4 primitive inches, which he suggested as indicating a knowledge of the Solar year, it is also exactly one 'quarter-aroura', as measured in ancient Egypt(1). The 'Sanctuary', nearAveburyis on the same longitude of 1ï¿½ 49' W and is exactly 1/4ï¿½ North. Stonehenge,AveburyandGlastonburyform a right angled triangle, of whichthe Glastonbury-Avebury follows the azimuth of the sun on 'May-day' A li   Sir Norman Lockyer, the Astronomer Royal, noticed that Stonehenge, Grovely Castle and Old Sarum formed a near-perfect equilateral triangle, with each side 6 miles in length. The Stonehenge-Old Sarum alignment continues south past Salisbury cathedral (built 1220 AD), Clearbury ring and Frankenbury(6). The Stonehenge-Grovely castle alignmentextends to the North-East beyond St Peters mound, Inkpen beacon, and the Neolithic 'Winterbourne camp'. To the South-West the line continues past Grovely Castle, Castle ditches and the 'Cerne-Abbas' giant to Puncknowle beacon on the South coast.  'An excavation funded with redundancy money shows Stonehenge was a settlement 3,000 years before it was built. The archaeological dig, a mile from the stones, has revealed that people have occupied the area since 7,500BC. The findings, uncovered by volunteers on a shoestring budget, are 5,000 years earlier than previously thought.

And carbon dating of material found at the site show people were there during every millennium in between'. The results of the Grenhatch Laser survey at Stonehenge in 2011, have revealed that Stonehenge represents the largest concentration of Prehistoric rock art in Southern England. It has also shown that different methods of dressing the stone were applied to different stones and perhaps more importantly, that the trilithon stone-circle was never completed, and was likely originally intended as a horseshoe shape monument. 'Steven Waller, an independent researcher in California, said the layout of the stones corresponded to the regular spacing of loud and quiet sounds created by acoustic interference when two instruments played at the same note continuously. In Neolithic times, the nature of sound waves - and their ability to reinforce and cancel each other  out - would have been mysterious enough to vergew on the magical, Waller said. Quiet patches created by acoustic interference could have created the ""auditory illusion"" that invisible objects stood between a listener and the instruments being played, he added' 'Scientists have succeeded in locating the exact source of some of the rock believed to have been used 5000 years ago to create Stonehenge's first stone circle. By comparing fragments of stone found at and around Stonehenge with rocks in south-west Wales, they have been able to identify the original rock outcrop that some of the Stonehenge material came from. The work - carried out by geologists Robert Ixer of the University of Leicester and Richard Bevins has pinpointed the source as a 70 metre long rock outcrop called Craig Rhos-y-Felin, near Pont Saeson in north Pembrokeshire. It's the first time that an exact source has been found for any of the stones thought to have been used to build Stonehenge'. Two previously undiscovered pits have been found in the Stonehenge Cursus which point to it once being used as a place of sun worship long before the stones were erected. The pits are positioned in such a way that when viewed from the 'Heel-Stone' at Stonehenge, they would have marked the rising and setting positions of the sun on the summers solstice. (20) It is thought the pits, positioned within the Neolithic Cursus pathway, could have formed a procession route for ancient rituals celebrating the sun moving across the sky at the midsummer solstice. Also discovered was a gap in the northern side of the Cursus, which may have been an entrance and exit point for processions taking place within the pathway. These discoveries hint that the site was already being used as an ancient centre of ritual prior to the stones being erected more than 5,000 years ago, the team said. Archaeologists have discovered a second Henge at Stonehenge, described as the most exciting find there in 50 years. The circular ditch surrounding a smaller circle of deep pits about a metre (3ft) wide has been unearthed at the world-famous site in Wiltshire. Archaeologists conducting a multi-million pound study believe timber posts were in the pits. It is orientated towards the great Stonehenge monument. Project leader Professor Vince Gaffney, from the University of Birmingham, said the discovery was ""exceptional"". The new ""henge"" - which means a circular monument dating to Neolithic and Bronze Ages - is situated about 900m (2,950ft) from the giant stones on Salisbury Plain. 'You seem to have a large-ditched feature, but it seems to be made of individual scoops rather than just a straight trench,"" he said. 'When we looked a bit more closely, we then realised there was a ring of pits about a metre wide going all the way around the edge. When you see that as an archaeologist, you just looked at it and thought, 'that's a henge monument' - it's a timber equivalent to Stonehenge. From the general shape, we would guess it dates backs to about the time when Stonehenge was emerging at its most complex. This is probably the first major ceremonial monument that has been found in the past 50 years or so'. British archaeologists have found the remains of a massive stone henge, or ceremonial circle, that was part of the ancient and celebrated Stonehenge complex, a find that is shedding new light on how the monument was built and its religious uses.The new henge, called 'Bluestonehenge' because it was built with blue Preseli dolerite mined more than 150 miles away in Wales, was on the banks of the River Avon, where ancient pilgrims carrying the ashes of their dead relatives began the journey from the river to Stonehenge, nearly two miles away. Some are calling it the ""little sister"" of Stonehenge.The approximately 25 massive bluestones were erected in a circle about 5,000 years ago, and eventually were encircled by a ditch and an earthen embankment. About 500 years later, however, the stones were moved and incorporated into Stonehenge itself. All that is left of the circle are the holes where the stones sat in the ground and a few chips of dolerite.The fact that the monument was found at the beginning of an avenue leading to Stonehenge and near the river ""not only solidifies the view that Stonehenge covers the entire landscape, but also the sacred importance of the river itself,"" said archaeologist Christine Hastorf of UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.""It means that there was a link between Stonehenge and the water, out to the ocean,"" she said. So far, they have found nine holes that they believe were part of a 30-foot-wide circle of about 25 standing stones. The holes are too wide and shallow for them to have contained wooden posts. The holes are also too small to have held sarsen stones, the larger limestone rocks that form part of Stonehenge and that were mined at Marlborough Downs 25 miles to the north.But the dimensions correlate precisely with those of bluestones in the inner circle of Stonehenge.The stone circle at 'Bluestonehenge' was eventually replaced by a henge, a circular ditch nearly 74 feet across with an external bank. Broken antler pickaxes in the ditch date its construction to about 2470 BC to 2280 BC. At least one entrance has been discovered, on the east side, and it contained a specially placed deposit of antlers, an antler pickaxe, cattle bones and stone and flint tools.The team also found the riverside end of the avenue to Stonehenge. It was marked by two parallel ditches about 54 feet apart. These originally held posts, forming a small palisade on either side. The avenue apparently terminated at or close to the outer bank of the newly discovered henge.Archaeologist Josh Pollard of Bristol University, a co-director of the project, noted that the circle ""should be considered an integral part of Stonehenge rather than a separate monument, and it offers tremendous insight into the history of its famous neighbour.""Previous research had shown that Stonehenge originally consisted of 56 bluestones set in a circle inside a ditch and bank. Sometime about 2500 BC, those stones were moved to their current location, leaving behind the holes now known as Aubrey holes. But there are 80 bluestones in Stonehenge and only 56 Aubrey holes, Parker Pearson said.""Where did the other 24 stones come from? I think we have solved that problem. They uprooted the other circle and moved the stones. Why they did it, we don't know.""But ""what it tells us for sure is that the river is essential to understanding Stonehenge,"" Parker Pearson added, because why else would the ancient builders have erected a monument there? Burning ceremonies appear to have been important rites at the site as well. When the stones at Bluestonehenge were pulled out, a lot of topsoil fell in, and that topsoil, the team found, is full of charcoal. ""They were building a lot of fires there. That may have been where they were cremating bodies"" before burying them at Stonehenge, Parker Pearson said.But the work is not done. For example, Parker Pearson said the team thinks it has located the quarry where the sarsen stones were excavated and is now working to confirm the identification.The discovery was announced by the National Geographic Society, which funded much of the research. 'A significant proportion of the newly discovered Neolithic remains show clear signs of skeletal trauma. Some had undergone operations to the skull, or had walked with a limp, or had broken bones. Modern techniques have established that many of these people had clearly travelled huge distances to get to south-west England, suggesting they were seeking supernatural help for their ills'. 'Darvill and Wainwright have also traced the bluestones - to the exact spot they came from in the Preseli hills, 250km away in the far west of Wales. Neolithic inscriptions found at this location indicate the ancient people there believed the stones to be magical and for the local waters to have healing properties'. While this theory may well have substance, it fails to take into account the astronomical significance of the location of Stonehenge, namely:  There are only two latitudes in the world at which you get the full moon on the Zenith, at Stonehenge andAlmendres(Portugal), in addition to which Stonehenge lies at the exact latitude at which the Sun and the Moon have their maximum settings at 90 Following the 2008 dig on the Aubrey Hole No 7, it was announced that the compacted chalk showed signs of the hole once having held a stone in it. The same compacted chalk marks have been found in other Aubrey holes, which revives the old theory that they were the original sitting places for the 56 Bluestones, which according to this report, would have been there since Stonehenge I. c. 3,000 BC. 'Contrary to claims made in the recent BBC Timewatch film, which promoted a theory of Stonehenge as a healing centre built after the practice of cremation burial had ceased, standing stones and burial of the dead may have been prominent aspects of Stonehengeï¿½s meaning and purpose for a millennium'.  Article: Arts and Humanities Research Council. (2008) - 'The excavation of Aubrey Hole 7 was directed over one week in August 2008 by Mike Parker-Pearson, Mike Pitts and Julian Richards for the Stonehenge Riverside Project... The pit had already been excavated twice: when discovered in 1920, and again in 1935 when all the cremated human bone found earlier at Stonehenge was reburied. Recovery of this bone for modern examination was the prime goal of the new dig (the bone was in excellent condition, and study will begin over the winter). Another reason was to look at the Aubrey Hole itself ï¿½ the first to be seen open since 1950. It was believed that these pits had been dug for oak poles, but Parker-Pearson had revived an old interpretation that they had held bluestones: the evidence of crushed and compacted chalk had been recorded in 1920 in three of the pits. He says, ï¿½Aubrey Hole 7 had crushed chalk on its base indicative of a standing stone. This had been missed by archaeologists twice before: it seems likely that similar evidence still survives in other Aubrey Holes. We propose that very early in Stonehengeï¿½s history, 56 Welsh bluestones stood in a ring 285 feet 6 inches (87m) acrossï¿½. He concludes, ï¿½This has sweeping implications for our understanding of Stonehenge.ï¿½ Professor Mike Parker-Pearson at the University of Sheffield says, ï¿½If all 56 pits had held stones, this would have been one of the first and largest stone circles in the country, made of Welsh bluestones in 3,000 BC. A recent claim that these stones arrived at Stonehenge in 2,300 BC would then relate to the time when the bluestones were moved into the centre of the site 700 years later. Stonehengeï¿½s history as envisaged since the 1950s is overturned.ï¿½ The new evidence from Aubrey Hole 7 suggests megaliths were present throughout Stonehengeï¿½s existence. The first three radiocarbon dates for human cremation burials, obtained in May from the only bones then available for study, range between about 3,000 and 2,300 BC'. 'The latest tests on the Amesbury Archer, whose grave astonished archaeologists last year with the richness of its contents, show he was originally from the Alps region, probably Switzerland, Austria or Germany. The tests also show that the gold hair tresses found in the grave are the earliest gold objects found in Britain. The grave of the Archer, who lived around 2,300BC, contained about 100 items, more than ten times as many objects as any other burial site from this time. When details were released, the media dubbed the Archer ï¿½The King of Stonehengeï¿½. The grave was found three miles from Stonehenge, near Amesbury in Wiltshire, last May during an excavation by Wessex Archaeology, based nearby at Salisbury, in advance of the building of a new housing scheme and school. The Archer was obviously an important man, and because he lived at the same time that the stones at Stonehenge were first being built, archaeologists believe he may have been involved in its creation. Tests were carried out on the Archerï¿½s teeth and bones and on the objects found in the grave, which included two gold hair tresses, three copper knives, flint arrowheads, wrist-guards and pottery. They show that he came from the Alps region, and that the copper knives came from Spain and France. This is evidence of the wide trade network that existed in the early Bronze Age. The gold dated to as early as 2,470 BC, the earliest gold objects found in Britain'.

The Stonehenge end of the avenue is aligned to the summer solstice sunrise, with the other end terminating at another henge/circle by the River Avon.
This newly discovered part of the Stonehenge landscape has been dubbed 'Bluestonehenge', due to the fact that it was formed of 24/25 'Bluestone' menhirs, currently thought to have been later moved to Stonehenge during the second phase of construction.
It is believed that it is one of a pair of 'portal' stones that would have marked the entrance to the circle from the earliest phase of building.
The Ditch and BankorThe 'Henge' -(Stonehenge I): Moving inwards from the Heel Stone is a large earthwork enclosure that consists of a ditch and an interior bank, the original height of which was calculated by Professor Atkinson as being about 1.8m (6ft).
Immediately adjacent to the bank is a ring of 56 pits, known as the Aubrey Holes, marked by circular concrete spots.
In the late 19th century Wiliam Petrie Flinders suggested that the stone circle was never completed and left open to the south west.
The evidence from the recentlaser survey of Stonehengesupports this early conclusion, suggesting that the monument was actually constructed as a large arc in a similar fashion to the arrangement of the bluestones in theQ&R Holes.
Furthermore, 'groundscans and probing have failed to reveal sockets for the missing south-west sector sarsens, providing no evidence for continuation of the sarsen circle from stone 14 to 20 in the north-west, with the exception of the monolith (16) marking the axis'.(23)  'The laser-scan survey carried out in March last year forEnglish Heritageby theGreenhatch Group, revealed 72 previously unknown axe and dagger carvings etched into the faces of five of the giant sarsen megaliths, trebling the number of carvings known at Stonehenge.
Prior to this laser survey, 44 prehistoric carvings had been identified at Stonehenge on Stones 3, 4, 5, and 53 commencing with Richard Atkinson's discovery of a number of Bronze Age carvings in 1953(23).
Heath suggested that the location of the quarry was determined through a geometric or geodetic p Although it has been suggested recently that the Bluestones were 'Glacial Erratics', and were therefore  not  transported  by hand, there are two specific evidences which suggest otherwise: Firstly, there have been no other discoveries of 'Erratic' bluestones in the area, and  secondly, the quarry in Preseli from which the stones originated, still show remains of unfinished blocks and several Neolithic engravings.
'There were also a small number of limestone blocks and slabs used in the construction of Stonehenge brought to the site for the specific purpose of packing material to support the much larger sarsen uprights.
The exact location has now been determined to be a 70m outcrop called Craig Rhos-y-Felin in northern Pembrokeshire.(Quick-link) Wiltshire archaeologist J F S Stone in 1947, excavated an area near the Cursus and discovered a scatter of bluestone fragments with a marked concentration near the Cursus itself, and in 2006 a sizeable fragment of The Altar Stone -Lying in the geometric centre of the monument is a worked recumbent megalith.It was most recently excavated in the 1950s, but no written records of the excavation survive.

British archaeologists have found the remains of a massive stone henge, or ceremonial circle, that was part of the ancient and celebrated Stonehenge complex, a find that is shedding new light on how the monument was built and its religious uses.The new henge, called 'Bluestonehenge' because it was built with blue Preseli dolerite mined more than 150 miles away in Wales, was on the banks of the River Avon, where ancient pilgrims carrying the ashes of their dead relatives began the journey from the river to Stonehenge, nearly two miles away.
Some are calling it the ""little sister"" of Stonehenge.The approximately 25 massive bluestones were erected in a circle about 5,000 years ago, and eventually were encircled by a ditch and an earthen embankment.
About 500 years later, however, the stones were moved and incorporated into Stonehenge itself.
All that is left of the circle are the holes where the stones sat in the ground and a few chips of dolerite.The fact that the monument was found at the beginning of an avenue leading to Stonehenge and near the river ""not only solidifies the view that Stonehenge covers the entire landscape, but also the sacred importance of the river itself,"" said archaeologist Christine Hastorf of UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the research.""It means that there was a link between Stonehenge and the water, out to the ocean,"" she said.
So far, they have found nine holes that they believe were part of a 30-foot-wide circle of about 25 standing stones.
The holes are also too small to have held sarsen stones, the larger limestone rocks that form part of Stonehenge and that were mined at Marlborough Downs 25 miles to the north.But the dimensions correlate precisely with those of bluestones in the inner circle of Stonehenge.The stone circle at 'Bluestonehenge' was eventually replaced by a henge, a circular ditch nearly 74 feet across with an external bank.
At least one entrance has been discovered, on the east side, and it contained a specially placed deposit of antlers, an antler pickaxe, cattle bones and stone and flint tools.The team also found the riverside end of the avenue to Stonehenge.
The avenue apparently terminated at or close to the outer bank of the newly discovered henge.Archaeologist Josh Pollard of Bristol University, a co-director of the project, noted that the circle ""should be considered an integral part of Stonehenge rather than a separate monument, and it offers tremendous insight into the history of its famous neighbour.""Previous research had shown that Stonehenge originally consisted of 56 bluestones set in a circle inside a ditch and bank.
But there are 80 bluestones in Stonehenge and only 56 Aubrey holes, Parker Pearson said.""Where did the other 24 stones come from?
For example, Parker Pearson said the team thinks it has located the quarry where the sarsen stones were excavated and is now working to confirm the identification.The discovery was announced by the National Geographic Society, which funded much of the research.
While this theory may well have substance, it fails to take into account the astronomical significance of the location of Stonehenge, namely:  There are only two latitudes in the world at which you get the full moon on the Zenith, at Stonehenge andAlmendres(Portugal), in addition to which Stonehenge lies at the exact latitude at which the Sun and the Moon have their maximum settings at 90 Following the 2008 dig on the Aubrey Hole No 7, it was announced that the compacted chalk showed signs of the hole once having held a stone in it.
The same compacted chalk marks have been found in other Aubrey holes, which revives the old theory that they were the original sitting places for the 56 Bluestones, which according to this report, would have been there since Stonehenge I.
'Contrary to claims made in the recent BBC Timewatch film, which promoted a theory of Stonehenge as a healing centre built after the practice of cremation burial had ceased, standing stones and burial of the dead may have been prominent aspects of Stonehengeï¿½s meaning and purpose for a millennium'.
(2008) - 'The excavation of Aubrey Hole 7 was directed over one week in August 2008 by Mike Parker-Pearson, Mike Pitts and Julian Richards for the Stonehenge Riverside Project...
The pit had already been excavated twice: when discovered in 1920, and again in 1935 when all the cremated human bone found earlier at Stonehenge was reburied.
He concludes, ï¿½This has sweeping implications for our understanding of Stonehenge.ï¿½ Professor Mike Parker-Pearson at the University of Sheffield says, ï¿½If all 56 pits had held stones, this would have been one of the first and largest stone circles in the country, made of Welsh bluestones in 3,000 BC.
A recent claim that these stones arrived at Stonehenge in 2,300 BC would then relate to the time when the bluestones were moved into the centre of the site 700 years later.
The Archer was obviously an important man, and because he lived at the same time that the stones at Stonehenge were first being built, archaeologists believe he may have been involved in its creation.",England,Europe

The low-reliefs were apparently carried out at the same time as the  building of the Chapel du St. Uzec. The menhir's back face has the appearance of being weather-worn, with several prominent grooves running down it. These grooves are similar to those seen on the 'Devil's arrows' in Yorkshire, England. They are commonly presumed to have been caused by weathering, although if this were the case, then one would expect to see it on other menhirs in both regions.

"Table  des Marchands, France",Passage mound,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/francelatabledesmarchants.htm,"La Table des Marchands, France","This passage-mound is  situated alongside theLe Grand Menhir Brise, and theEr Grahtumulus which combine together  to form the Lochmariaquer site. The capstone has been shown to have once been a part of a larger stone, which is believed to have once stood alongside Le Grande menhir Bris Thelocation of this neat little passage-mound betrays its obvious importance. It was built only yards from Le Grand Menhir Brisï¿½, once the tallest menhir in Europe, and the centre stone for the great lunar observatory at Carnac. The mound has been restored five times since 1811, denying us the means of ever seeing it again in its original form, but it still contains two huge engraved stones that reveal much about the builders of the mound.  Firstly - The builders re-used stone from the original construction at the site (radio-carbon dated at 4,500 BC). The capstone, and possibly the 'end-stone' are parts of larger menhirs that were already quarried, moved and cut long before the mound was built. It is therefore probable that at the time of construction (Approximately 3,000 BC), that the area had already achieved recognition. Secondly - The construction that proceeded the Table des Marchands (SeeLe Grand Menhir Brisï¿½), was designed to measure the lunar cycle, whereas the Table des Marchands is orientated to the mid-summer sunrise (andGavrinisto the winter solstice). This indicates a dramatic shift in thinking. The re-use of masonry is a common thing, even with such obviously important stone, but the fact that the stones were not re-engraved tends to suggest that the engravings themselves may have had an importance of their own. It is curious therefore that the engravings were left face down and visible at La Table des Marchands, but were placed face-up and therefore hidden at Gavrinis. Excavations directed by J. L'Helgouac'h proved that the end-stone was set in place before the dolmen itself was built. In all likelihood, an open air stele (probably related to the Grand-Menhir alignment) was strategically placed and the passage grave built around it.(3)   The End-stone - Chronology -   Prof Muller of Germany believes that'The signs...refer to particular dates in the trajectory of the moon and to eclipses of both the sun and moon'. He goes on to explain '...I came across four sequences of numbers which revealed the calculations behind the signs. They number 56; This number is found inStonehenge...known as the Aubrey holes.

It is approximately 10m long and only 1m high, and when covered over would have required anyone wanting to enter the chamber to crawl along its length. The floor of the passage is covered in rubble, possibly remnants of a pavement or debris from collapsed roof-stones.  The chamber is composed of eight huge granite stones, capped-off with a stone flattened on the underside and rounded on top. The large size of the chamber (second only toZambujeiro), leaves no doubt as to the original importance of this passage mound.   The stones are all roughly 4m high (over ground level), and the stone at the rear is the largest at around 4m high x 3m wide and 1/2 thick (4 x 3 x 1/2 = 6mï¿½). There are no visible markings inside the chamber.One of the stones has been broken in half at ground-level, and lies on the ground outside, where it fell.  The large stone above the entrance has slipped on the right hand side, and can be seen to have been worked along its bottom edge so as to fit neatly over the last two stones of the passage (see below). From inside the chamber, it is possible to determine the reason for the movement, as the supporting stone on the right hand side can be seen to have broken.    Directly north of the moundis a rock formation which, with a little imagination, looks like a Dragons  head. Whether or not this feature was one of the reasons why the Anta was located here is unknown, but it certainly contributes to the already magical atmosphere of the site.  The passage leads from the mound at roughly 15ï¿½south of true west, directing it towards the rising winter solstice sun or along the azimuth of the spring full moon (a feature shared by the other two Alentejo passage mounds,ZambujeiroandSan Gens). The passage has a distinct curve in it reminiscent of the passage atNewgrange, where it is now recognised as a deliberate design, restricting the entry of sunlight into the chamber for just a few hours of the day on the Solstice. There are several prominent rocky outcrops several metres away in the field in front of the passage, but they appear to have no markings on them.  At the other end of the Stone outcrop that forms the dragon, is the following stone feature. It faces the dolmen and has presumably watched over it since its construction.

In ancient Irish religion and mythology Temair was the sacred place of dwelling for the gods, and was the entrance to the otherworld. Saint Patrick is said to have come to Tara to confront the ancient religion of the pagans at its most powerful site. In fact, this small cluster of megaliths represents a single component of an extended prehistoric landscape which would have provided the ability to recognising specific moments of the lunar and solar cycles throughout the year. In the case of Tara, the chamber of the 'Mound of hostages' is aligned to mark the November 8th and February 4th,quarterdays (along withDowthand Cairns L and U atLoughcrew). Tara is only 10 miles distant from TheBoyne Valley complex, which is clearly visible from there.  The 'Mound of the Hostages'- The most prominent and oldest monument on the hill is theMound of the Hostages,upon which stands the 'Stone of destiny'(below). The Mound of Hostages dates back to the Neolithic period and is contemporary with theBoyne Valleystructures(1).   Tara Hill was one of the most venerated religious spots in early Ireland and the seat of the High Kings of Ireland from the 3rd century until 1022. Despite its importance, the expectant visitor may be disappointed in what he sees as, at Tara there are no signs of regal past, nor impressive remains, only the remains of  earthworks. But this cluster of megaliths represents a part a larger system capable of recognising specific parts of the lunar and solar cycles. In the case of Tara, it the chamber of the Mound of hostages' is aligned to mark the November, February quarter days, along with Dowth and Cairns L and U at Loughcrew. Tara is only 10 miles distant from The Boyne Valley, which is clearly visible from there.   The Hill of Tara in the Royal County of Meath was for centuries in ancient times the seat of the High King of Ireland, the Ard Ri. This monolith is called the Lia Fial, The Stone of Fal or the Stone of Destiny. The tradition is that the High Kings of Ireland would be crowned here, and that the Stone would roar or cry out loudly if touched by the true High King. Some believe that the original Stone of Fal was taken to England and placed under the Coronation Throne in Westminster Abbey, then in the current Century stolen, taken into safe keeping in Scotland. Who now knows which is the true Lia Fial or where it lies! On the Hill of Tara there are the remains of many other earthworks. To the South of the Mound of the Hostages, inside the bank and the ditch of the so-calledRoyal Enclosure, stand two linked ring-forts known as theRoyal Seatand theForradh. The Forradh has two banks and two ditches around it. In its centre lies theLia Fï¿½il, the Stone of Destiny, the most obvious phallic symbol of ancient Ireland. It once stood near the Mound of the Hostages, and it is said to be the stone of the coronation of the kings of Ireland. It roared three times when the future king stood on it. Other legends say it was the pillow of Jacob or the coronation Stone of Scone of Westminster Abbey. To the south of the Royal Enclosure are the remains of another circular earthwork known as theFort of King Laoghaire, where the king is said to be buried fully armed and in an upright position in order to see his enemies coming. To the north of the Royal Enclosure there are other round earthworks, two of them known asSloping Trenchesand oneGrï¿½inne's Fort, named for King Cormac's daughter who was the heroine of the tragic love tale of Diarmuid and Grï¿½inne.  Rath Maeve Henge- Chronology - Archaeo-astronomy- ï¿½The monuments around Tara cannot be viewed in isolation, or as individual sites, but must be seen in the context of an intact archaeological landscape, which should not under any circumstances be disturbed, in terms of visual or direct impact on the monuments themselvesï¿½ Scheduled to open in 2010, the M3's loudest critics concede much of the damage is already done ï¿½ 38 archaeological sites unearthed during construction thus far have been carved from the landscape. Among the now vanished finds, a newly discovered national monument at Lismullin that one leading archaeologist described as""The wooden equivalent of Stonehenge."" ""All these sites, including the monument at Lismullin, were part and parcel of the greater whole that is the Hill of Tara complex and now they are gone, demolished. The damage is complete and irreversible,"" said Vincent Salafia of Tara Watch. ""Some would say, `Give up the fight. The deed is done.' But we're not giving up because what we are most against is the building of the motorway through the valley that is at the heart of the Tara complex. It's a long ways from completion and there is still time to come to our senses. Opponents of the M3 have called on the European Parliament and the European Commission to intervene by asking the Irish government to review its plans and conduct an independent investigation into the highwayï¿½s impact on the Tara landscape. Campaigners first approached the commission for help in June 2005. The commission subsequently determined that the road construction violated EU law governing environmental impact assessments; however, it has yet to actually submit a case before the European Court of Justice, and that delay has allowed the Irish government and the Roads Authority to continue construction. On April 2, 2008, campaigners came before the EU Parliamentï¿½s petitions committee to resolve the problem. An EU Commission spokesman said the commission would be submitting an application to the court in the coming months; however, he said the commission did not have the authority to halt construction in the interim, as road opponents had hoped. Those who are expert in this area and in the area of Tara are of no doubt that this ritual site, really a temple, is part of the extended Tara complex. It is about 500metres from the area of Rath Lugh also flagged as being under threat of the motorway. This is the place about which there was such a furore in January. The NRA is trying to fit the road between these monuments ï¿½ this was shown in photographs in the past.This point in the Gabhra Valley is the entrance to Tara. It was more or less expected that a henge would be found in this location. They are usually associated with Passage Tombs. Conor Newman and Joe Fenwick recorded the existence of a straight line of Passage Tombs running from the river Boyne southwards right through the Gabhra Valley and up to the top of the hill. The Mound of the Hostages is surrounded by a henge also, this is 200metres in diameter and is much larger than the Lismullin Henge that is 80metres, still a very large area. These two henges are about the same distance apart as Knowth and Dowth are from each other. No one would doubt that the latter two are related to each other.

"Tarxien, Malta",Temple Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/maltahaltarxien.htm,"Hal Tarxien, Malta","Several rooms have been excavated from a site that covers several acres. Inside the monumental main entrance (which is a modern reconstruction) of the temple, is the lower portion of a 'fertility goddess'. The South face of the temple houses a spring-fed cistern. The central temple contains relief carvings of bulls and running spirals. When first excavated, the interior of these temples was noted to have been 'reddened by fire'(1). This temple lies only several hundreds of yards from the Hal-SaflieniHypogeum, leading many to consider it the 'pair' to the underground temple. While other temples on the islands were certainly built with more grandiose stones, the wide variety of features and uses for stone seen at Hal-Tarxien cannot be matched anywhere else. There are four distinct temple units at Tarxien. The oldest one, smaller of size an separated from the others, was built in the Ggantija phase and has the typical five-asped plan, just like Ggantija temple itself. The other three are joined together by a common outer wall. The middle temple was the last one to be erected and was wedged between the other two, spoiling the symmetry of the complex itself.  These huge rectangular blocks which lie to the extreme right of the entrance and to the left about 50ft each way are yet to be fully understood. Originally, large slabs stood at the back of these rectangular stones to form the front wall of the building. Of these wall slabs only a fragment, about 5ft wide remains behind the first block on the right. Each end of the semi-circular front wall ends in a remarkable structure, of which we can only conjecture a purpose. Zammit named these structures 'Divination Blocks' due to a lack of similar features on the island. '...A step is cut in front, and a barrel-shaped stone stands before it. The surface of this block is slightly concave in the middle, with a flat ledge round three of its sides. Six conical pits, about 1 foot deep, are cut deeply into this block, one on the edge and five on the square surface. The use for which this block of stone was intended is not apparent. As a great number of stone balls, varying between two and three inches in diameter were found heaped up in the vicinity of this curious stone block, one is induced to believe these balls were in some way connected with the curious structure. The stones may have been thrown from a distance on the surface o the block, wither in the course of some game or, better still, or the purpose of divination... The line in which these pits were dug out has suggested to some the idea of the constellation of the Southern Cross, for example, which at the time when the temples were in use, was seen easily in our hemisphere'. This is THE earth-mother-earth figure. The full-size model would have stood over 3m high. It has been suggested that it may have represented a male figure, but the numerous other female figurines found on Malta make this idea very unlikely indeed. The original is balanced delicately in the museum of archaeology, Valleta. 'Six of the steps are laid between the walls, the last two in a block of stone placed at the top of the stairs.

"Tenochtitlan, Mexico",Aztec Capital,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicotenochtitlan.htm,"Tenochtitlan, Mexcio","Tenochtitlan, the Capital of the Aztec empire, was built on a cluster of small natural islands on Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico. The founding of capital city in the middle of a marshy lake may at first seem absurd, but its exact location was foretold and fulfilled by prophesy, and Tenochtitlan indeed grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica, and at its height was one of the largest cities in the world. The city was originally built by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan, which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan, and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards. In 1524, the municipality of Mexico City was established, known asMï¿½xico Tenochtitlï¿½n, and as of 1585 when it officially became known asLa Ciudad de Mï¿½xico(Mexico City). Tenochtitlan was the capital city of the Aztec civilization, founded in 1325 by the Mexica people. The Aztecs, or Mexica as they called themselves, were not originally from the Valley of Mexico, but had migrated from the north (from a mythical island called Aztlan, ""The Place of Herons"") Historically, it is known that the Mexica and other tribes located in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, known as the Chichimeca, left their homes because of a great drought. This story is told in several surviving codices, in which the Mexica are shown carrying with them the idol of their patron deityHuitzilopochtli. After two centuries of migration, at around AD 1250, the Mexica arrived in the Valley of Mexico. When the Mexica finally arrived in the Valley of Mexico, the earlier great cities of Teotihuacan and Tula had been abandoned for centuries and other groups of people were already settled on the best lands. Because of this the Mexica had a troubled time and were forced to settle on inhospitable land. They became vassals of the city of Culhuacan, a prestigious city whose rulers were considered the heirs of the Toltecs. It is said that in acknowledgement for their assistance during battle, the Mexica were given one of the daughters of the King of Culhuacan to be worshipped as a goddess/priestess. When the king arrived to attend the ceremony, he found one of the Mexica priests dressed in the flayed skin of his daughter: the Mexica reported to the king that their God Hutzilopochtli had asked for the sacrifice of the princess. The sacrifice and flaying of the Culhua Princess provoked a ferocious battle, which the Mexica lost. After they were forced out of Chapultepec, according to Mexica myth, the Aztecs wandered for weeks, searching for a place to settle. Huitzilopochtli appeared to the Mexica leaders and indicated a place where a great eagle was perched on a cactus killing a snake. This place, in the middle of a marsh with no ground-rock at all, was where the Mexica founded their capital city, Tenochtitlan. The year was2 Calli(Two House) in the Aztec calendar, which translates to AD 1325. A thriving culture developed, and the Aztec civilization came to dominate other tribes all around Mexico. The small natural island was perpetually enlarged as Tenochtitlan grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica. Commercial routes were developed that brought goods from places as far as the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Ocean and even the Inca Empire. Only 100 years after its conception, Tenochtitlan had become a city that rivalled any of its European contemporaries and perhaps any in the world. Scholars estimate that between 200,000 and 250,000 people lived in Tenochtitlan in 1500, more than four times the population of London at that time. 'When we saw so many cities and villages built in the water and other great towns on dry land we were amazed and said that it was like the enchantments (...) on account of the great towers and cues and buildings rising from the water, and all built of masonry. And some of our soldiers even asked whether the things that we saw were not a dream? (...) I do not know how to describe it, seeing things as we did that had never been heard of or seen before, not even dreamed about'. The Aztec capital of Tenochtitlï¿½n (at modern Mexico City) was founded in 1325 on a muddy island in the lake which at that time filled the Basin of Mexico. A second group of Aztecs also settled the nearby island of Tlatelolco in 1358. Both sites began as small collections of reed huts but, with the growth of Aztec power, quickly developed into cities, eventually fusing into a single unit.Tenochtitlï¿½n was joined to the mainland by three causeways.An aqueduct supplied fresh water from Chapultepec. Along with the many palaces and marketplaces of the city theTecpan, a central plaza contained the two principal temples, built on a huge terraced pyramid (El Templo Mayor).  By 1519, the year the Spaniards arrived, Tenochtitlï¿½n had a population of more than 200,000. It was laid out on a grid plan and covered more than 12 km2 (4.6 mi2), much of this consisting of reclaimed swampland that formed a zone of fertile garden plots around the edge of the city. The Aztec city-states in the valley were an extremely proficient hydraulic society. They used bridges, causeways, dikes, sluices, canals, aqueducts, terrace farming, and chinampas (artificial, floating gardens) to sustain the population and allow for navigation about the city. A 16-km (10-mi) dike sealed off part of the lake and controlled flooding, so that Tenochtitlï¿½n, like a Mexican Venice, stood on an island in an artificial lagoon. Causeways linked the island to the lakeshore, and canals reached to all parts of the city. The Tenochtitlans used the aqueduct water from Chapultepec for bathing and cleaning and they used mountain spring water for drinking and cooking. The market district, was estimated by Spanish explorer Bernal Diaz del Castillo to be twice the size of Seville and bustling with over 60,000 shoppers and traders. The produce and goods for this market and several others in the city came mostly from the intricate and efficiently irrigated gardens created by the Aztecs in the shallow lakes surrounding the city. These gardens, calledchinampas, were artificial island plots of 30 x 2.5-3 meters. These ï¿½floating gardensï¿½ produced 3 crops a year and grew at least a half to two-thirds of the food consumed by the 200,000 residents of Tenochtitlan. Irrigated by the surrounding lake water, the chinampas were fertilized by digging up the nutrient-rich mud from the bottom of the canals and also by using human waste from the city itself. In this way, Tenochtitlan was able to better fertilize its crops while treating its wastewater― creating a healthier living environment for all. Mexico city is currently trying to create a waste-water treatment system incorporating the use of chinampas similar to the ones used by the Aztecs so long ago.(2)  At the centre of Tenochtitlï¿½n was a large walled precinct, theTeclan, presumed to be the focus of ceremonial and sacred activity, containing the main temples (dedicated to Huitzilopochtli, Tlaloc the Rain God, and Quetzalcï¿½atl); also found there were schools and priests' quarters, a court for the ritual ballgame, a wooden rack holding the skulls of sacrificial victims, and many other commemorative sculptures. The largest structure of the complex was the Templo Mayor, said to be the very location of the fulfilment of the Aztec prophesy. The Templo Mayor was effectively destroyed in 1521 after Tenochtitlï¿½n was conquered by Hernï¿½n Cortï¿½s, and Mexico City was built over its ruins. It was rediscovered accidentally in 1978 workmen digging a trench for an electricity cable northeast of the Cathedral found a monumental 3.25m diameter stone disk carved with the image of the dismembered moon goddessCoyolxauhqui. (See image right) According to Aztec legend, when Coyolxauhqui was killed on the summit of Coatepec by Huitzilopochtli,her beheaded body was torn apart when it fell down the mountainside. A monument to Coyolxauhqui, thus, would be expected to be found at the foot of a ""mountain,"". Excavation soon revealed huge serpent heads, which turned out to flank stairways to the temple top where, as might be expected, there was a shrine to Huitzilopochtli. The Templo Mayor had been foundï¿½and in the following years large parts of the sacred precinct over which the Temple presided were revealed. This first temple was a simple structure made of mud and wood, but construction of the Templo Mayor began in the year designated 2-Rabbit (1390). It was subsequently re-built seven times and enlarged eleven times - the last time in 1487, when several thousand people were sacrificed over 4 days during its re-consecration (The remains of which were discovered in a pit at the base of the monument). As befitted its importance, the Templo Mayor was always the tallest structure in Tenochtitlï¿½n. In the last stage of construction, dating to the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, the pyramidal platform was composed of four sloped tiers with a passage between each level, built on a great platform that measured approximately 80 x 100 meters. It had two stairways of access to the top, where there were two shrines dedicated to Tlaloc on the left side, and to Huitzilopochtli on the right side. The two temples, at approximately 30 meters in height, were originally covered over entirely with stucco and polychrome paint.  The disc-shaped stone measures 12 feet in diameter and is 3 feet thick. Being covered with unknown symbols, the Spanish decided to bury it underneath the Zocalo, or central plaza of the city soon after they toppled the Aztec empire in 1521. The new rulers also tore down the grand temple and, at the opposite end of the plaza, built a large cathedral. Soon after its 1790 discovery, the 25-ton stone was embedded it in the wall of the cathedral's western tower. When Mexico achieved independence from Spain in the early 19th century, it retained the Catholic religion but also developed a growing interest and pride in its indigenous history and culture. General Porfirio Diaz ordered the stone removed to the national Museum of Archaeology and History in 1885. There are several theories for how the stone was used. it may have been simply a monument or possibly a sacrificial altar. In the centre is the terrible sun god,Tonatuih(some believe this may be the earth god). Each of his hands holds a human heart, and his tongue is a ritual blade for sacrifice. The four squares that come next supposedly show the four previous creations that perished (by jaguars, wind, rain and water). Next come the 20 signs for the days of the Aztec month. The 5 dots are the 5 unlucky days, days of sacrifice. Finally, surrounding the Aztec calendar stone there are the snakes that come head to head. The symbols may represent the 52 years in a cycle. Between the tails is a symbol probably showing the date the stone was carved. At the edge are 8 equally spaced holes.   Before the Spanish had even landed on the Americas, their arrival was foretold in the shape of an ancient myth which said that Quetzalcoatl would return from the east (on the very year they arrived - 'Reed 1' of that 52 year cycle, or 1519). The prophets of Mexico had long predicted that Quetzalcoatl, or the Feathered Serpent, would return to claim the land that was once his and the kingdom would be his to reign over. When Hernado Cortes arrived that year, they believed he was the god that was foretold. he came with 16 mounted and armed soldiers, several hundred people including 550 soldiers, 100 sailors, 200 Cubans, a few Africans and a number of women. they had come on 11 ships total. the Aztecs called them ï¿½floating mountains"" and sent word to the King, Moctezuma, the king of the Aztecs. Cortez set towards Tenochtitlan, a path which led to the slaughter of 15 - 30,000 in Cholula alone before he reached the capital. In the process, through fear and pure guile, he managed to 'convert' several thousands of  peripheral tribes to join him in overthrowing the yoke of the Aztec Montezuma. Cortez arrived at Tenochtitlan playing the role of returning King, and now fully aware of the prophesy. Cortez almost immediately seized Moctezuma in his own palace and made him his prisoner as insurance against Aztec revolt, and demanded an enormous ransom of gold which was duly delivered. A stale-mate was reached for several weeks until Cortez managed to dramatically escape losing and killing thousands of men in the process. He soon returned armed with tens of thousands ofTlaxcaltecaallies only to find that smallpox had taken hold of the population, something to which the Spanish were accustomed... When the fighting eventually finished, almost the entire city of Tenochtitlï¿½n was destroyed and some 120,000 to 240,000 Aztecs killed either through disease or battle.(3) ","(19.4326077, -99.133208)",19.4326077,-99.133208,"Tenochtitlan, the Capital of the Aztec empire, was built on a cluster of small natural islands on Lake Texcoco in the Valley of Mexico.
The founding of capital city in the middle of a marshy lake may at first seem absurd, but its exact location was foretold and fulfilled by prophesy, and Tenochtitlan indeed grew to become the largest and most powerful city in Mesoamerica, and at its height was one of the largest cities in the world.
The city was originally built by the Aztecs in 1325 as Tenochtitlan, which was almost completely destroyed in the 1521 siege of Tenochtitlan, and subsequently redesigned and rebuilt in accordance with the Spanish urban standards.
Tenochtitlan was the capital city of the Aztec civilization, founded in 1325 by the Mexica people.
The Aztecs, or Mexica as they called themselves, were not originally from the Valley of Mexico, but had migrated from the north (from a mythical island called Aztlan, ""The Place of Herons"") Historically, it is known that the Mexica and other tribes located in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States, known as the Chichimeca, left their homes because of a great drought.
After two centuries of migration, at around AD 1250, the Mexica arrived in the Valley of Mexico.
When the Mexica finally arrived in the Valley of Mexico, the earlier great cities of Teotihuacan and Tula had been abandoned for centuries and other groups of people were already settled on the best lands.

"Teotihuacan, Mexico",Pyramid Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicoteotihuacan.htm,"Teotihuacan, Mexico","It was suspected by Stansbury Hagar that the city had been built as a 'map of heaven'. During the 1960's and 1970's a comprehensive mathematical survey was carried out by Hugh Harleston Jr, who found that the principle structures line up along the'Street of the dead'(and beyond), from which he concluded the city was a precise scale model of the solar system, including Uranus, Neptune and Pluto (not rediscovered until 1787, 1846 and 1930 respectively.(21). Although not much is known about the earliest phase of Teotihuacan, From theTzacualli to Miccaotli phases; A.D. 1-200, which were characterized by monumental construction, Teotihuacan quickly became the largest and most populous urban center in the New World. Teotihuacan was the sixth largest city on the world during its period of greatest prosperity, according to an estimated population of 125,000 (Millon 1993:33). The city seems to have functioned for centuries as a well-developed urban centre until its sudden collapse, sometime around the 7th cent AD. The Avenue of the dead - The Avenue of the Dead was the main street of Teotihuacan. It ran south for more than 3km, beginning at the Moon Plaza and extending beyond the Ciudadela and the Great Compound complexes to the south. According to Millon (Cowgill 1992a:96; Millon 1981:221), the avenue continued even further south, terminating near the edge of the mountains on the distant horizon.  The dimensions of the Pyramid of the Sun incorporate 'Pi' in the following way: (4 x Π) x h = Perimeter / Circumference of base.(21)The pyramids base area is almost the same as that of the great pyramid ofGhiza.(21), (12),The height is almost half. It was discovered in 1971, that leading from a natural cave, 6m below the pyramid, and running for approx' 100m to the east, is a natural passageway.(12).It opens close under the centre of the Pyramid into a 'four-leaved-clover' shape, each 'leaf', about 60 ft in circumference and containing beautifully engraved slate discs and highly polished mirrors. There was also a complex drainage system of interlocking segments of carved rock pipes.(21). Mexico's first great city, Teotihuacan coalesced out of a number of small hamlets in the early years of the first century B.C., after, as archaeologists believe, the discovery of a four-chambered lava-tube cave in the Teotihuacan Valley. Caves played an integral role in Mesoamerican religion, being places of emergence of gods and ancestors as well as portals to the underworld, the world of demons and other potent beings. The Teotihuacan cave may have held particular significance, its four lobes representing the four parts of the Mesoamerican cosmos. It soon became a focal point of ritual activity and settlement in the valley. Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the Sun was built directly over the cave in the second century A.D.(2)  Article: Feb: 2013: (LaTimes.com) 'Mexican archaeologists announced this week that a figure of the god, called Huehueteotl, was found in a covered pit at the apex of the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan. The discovery suggests that a long-disappeared temple at the top of the pyramid was used to perform ritual offerings to the fire god, Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, or INAH, said in a statement Monday. Archaeologists found the Huehueteotl, along with two stone pillars, in a covered pit about 15 feet deep, at a height of about 214 feet from the ground. The pit is below the remnants of a platform at the top of the Pyramid of the Sun that probably served as the foundation for a temple'.  Article: Feb, 2012 (PressTV) Archaeologists have discovered a jade funerary mask during their excavations under the pyramid of the sun. The mask was part of an 'offering' found under the pyramid,seven human burials including children who were buried before the construction of the building. 'Several numbers of obsidian artefacts were also found including projectile heads and small knives along with an anthropomorphic eccentric artefact and three anthropomorphic figurines with shell and pyrite eyes'. The discovery of an Olmec Jade mask 'beneath' the pyramid suggests a cultural connection between theOlmecsand the original builders. The archaeologists also determined that'During excavating the tunnel into the heart of the pyramid three architectural structures were discovered that are older than the current Pyramid of the Sun'(6). Future analysis of these structures will undoubtedly better our understanding of the origin of the Teotihuacï¿½n complex itself.   'A burial chamber     containing what may be the remains of a retainer of an early     ruler of Teotihuacan, an ancient metropolis 30 miles northeast     of Mexico City, has been found within the Pyramid of the Moon,     at the northern end of the site's main thoroughfare, the Street     of the Dead. Discovered by Arizona State University (ASU)     archaeologist Saburo Sugiyama, the skeleton, thought to be that     of an adult male who was bound and sacrificed, was buried in a     square chamber 11.3 feet on each side and five feet deep. He was     surrounded by more than 150 burial offerings, including obsidian     and greenstone figurines, obsidian blades and points, pyrite     mirrors, conch and other shells, and the remains of eight birds     (hawks or falcons) and two jaguars, which may have been buried     alive. ""The quality of the offerings,"" says Sugiyama, ""is     exceptional, particularly in light of the more than 1,200     burials found at the site so far."" The grave, which dates to about A.D. 150, is associated with pyramid's fourth construction phase. What we see today is the fifth and last, built ca. A.D. 250. ""The pyramid of the Moon,"" says Sugiyama, ""started out as a rather small temple beneath what is now the five-tiered platform in front of the pyramid. After two additional construction episodes, the builders embarked on the construction of the pyramid itself.""(2) This pyramid was built over existing structures, and has been built over since by the 'Adosada', which was integrated into the design of the original temple, archaeology has re-exposed the original temple of the feathered serpent,  upon which can be seen the numerous 'feathered serpents' heads carved into the temples facade and stairwell. Aprehistoric structure had been buried beneath a much later mound immediately in front of it. The exposed temple still had traces of multicoloured paintings on the rows of rectangular panels superimposed on the sloping walls with sculpted serpent heads lining the sides of the stairway and facing blocks.(21). Several mass graves, excavated between 1982 and 1989, were found around and beneath the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Quetzelcoatl) at the southern end of the site. The 137 people buried there were apparently sacrificed, their hands tied behind their backs, during the construction of the pyramid.(2)  'Following 8 months of investigative work, archaeologists of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) located, 12 meters below, the entrance to the tunnel that leads to galleries under the Feathered Serpent Temple, in Teotihuacan. The tunnel passes under the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, the most important building of the Citadel, ï¿½and the entry was located a few meters from the pyramid. A vertical shaft of almost 5 meters by side is the access to the tunnel: it goes 14 meters deep, and the entrance leads to a nearly 100 meters long corridor that ends in a series of underground galleries excavated in the rock. The tunnel was discovered in late 2003 by Sergio Gomez and Julie Gazzola, but its exploration has required several years of planning and managing the financial resources necessary to carry out research at the highest scientific level.So far, 200 tons of earth have been withdrawn, he said, while doing this we have found about 60,000 pieces of artefacts and pottery. ï¿½Several indications suggest that access to the underground passage was closed between 200 and 250 AD, probably after depositing something inside. One of the hypotheses postulate that, within the large chamber detected by the GPR, we could locate the remains of important people in the city. ï¿½ The investigations have led to know with certainty that this tunnel was made prior to the construction of the Temple of the Feathered Serpent and the Citadel. The tunnel is contemporary with a large architectural structure, which could be a ball game court, according to the form of the ground. According to the hypothesis about the meaning and symbolism of the tunnel, archaeologist Sergio Gomez, said the tunnel had to be linked to concepts related to the underworld, hence it is possible that in this place were carried out initiation rituals and the divine investiture of Teotihuacan rulers, since the power was acquired in these sacred spaces. the excavation have permitted to recuperate thousands of small ornaments, made of shell, jade from Guatemala, serpentine, slate and obsidian, thrown by the people from Teotihuacan as offerings at the moment of closing the entrance. Several parts of a frieze that may have decorated a building prior to the Temple of the Feathered Serpent, and that was dismantled, have been found as well'. ""It is possible,"" concluded Sergio Gï¿½mez, ""that the tunnel discovered would have been the most important and sacred element around which the first constructions were undertaken on this site about 100 B.C., and where later on The Citadel was erected, which was the magnificent stage where rituals associated with the myths of creation and the beginning of the mythic time must have been performed."" Following the discovery of mica in the Pyramid of the Sun, two more sheets, approx' 90 ft square, and laid directly on top of one another, were discovered beneath the stone paved floor of the Mica temple. Trace element testing showed it to originate 2000 miles away in Brazil.(21)Similar finds of Mica have been found at some Mayan sites. The first sheets of mica were found in between two of the upper levels of the Pyramid of the Sun. The discovery occurred in 1906, when the complex was restored. But the mica was removed and sold as soon as it had been excavated, by Leopoldo Batres, the man in charge of the project.More recently, a ï¿½Mica Templeï¿½ has been discovered on the site, but this time, the mica has remained in situ. The temple sits around a patio about 300 metres south of the west face of the Pyramid of the Sun. Directly under a floor paved with heavy rock slabs, they found two massive sheets of mica. The sheets are 90 feet square and form two layers, one laid directly on top of the other. As it sits underneath a stone floor, its use was obviously not decorative, but functional.Mica is a substance containing different metals, depending on the kind of rock formation in which it is found. The type of mica found at Teotihuacï¿½n indicates a type that is only found in Brazil, more than 2000 miles away. The same South American mica was found in Olmec sites. It is clear that its presence in Teotihuacï¿½n involved a lot of effort ï¿½ and it thus must have played an important role According to most sources the mica is said to originate from a source in Brazil, over 2000miles distant (suggesting transport by boat),  for Example, Childress(3)says of it 'According to expert opinions the mica found at Teotihuacï¿½n is a type found only in faraway Brazil', While Fagan(4), calls it 'locally mined mica'. The jury is out on this one.  It is a curious fact that the city of Teotihuacï¿½n was meticulously laid out on a grid which is offset 15ï¿½.5 from the cardinal points. Its main avenue, the ""Street of the Dead,"" runs from 15ï¿½.5 east of north to 15ï¿½.5 west of south, as does its most impressive structure, the Pyramid of the Sun, which is directly oriented to a point 15ï¿½.5 north of west.

"Thornborough, England",Triple Henge Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandthornborough.htm,"Thornborough, England","The Thornborough Henges are part of a larger, sacred Neolithic landscape which was used for over a thousand years. The Henges were built over a pre-existing Cursus, which is no longer visible above ground; a part of which has been irreversibly lost through the continued efforts of 'Tarmac PLC', to extract the spirit of the site by quarrying around it. Knight and Butler proposed that the complex was positioned at 1/10th the planets circumference from the pole (Based on a division of 366ï¿½). The Henges all have circumferences of 732 megalithic yards (366 x 2), and the distance between the centres of the three Henges is 366 MR and 360 MR(4) The three Henges at Thornborough are a part of the ancient English landscape. They follow the sameoff-centrealignment seen at other triple-circles in England. Even before the Henges were built, the triple-circle was built over an existingCursus, suggesting that Thornborough was alreadyan important ritual centre to the Neolithic residents between 4,000 and 2,000 BC, and although we have little or no idea of what the rituals were, it is proposed that they were partly astronomical in nature.  The Cursus: The central Henge was built over a previously existing Cursus, which is 1.1km long and 44m wide. although nothing is visible of the Cursus now, and digging has unfortunately ruined the western end of the Cursus, the eastern end is hopefully going to be protected under new agreements. The Henges:All three are unusual in that the banks are constructed from the earth of two ditches; one dug around the outside of the Henge, and the other excavated inside. In all case the internal ditch was of neater, better construction and a broad  The realisation that the circumference of the Thornborough Henges were 722 MY, led Knight and Butler(4)to propose that the Henges were used as an 'observatory' for viewing the motions of Orion in particular. They also pointed out that the Henge at Stonehenge has a circumference of 366 MY (as does the Dorchester Big-rings Henge).  In accordance with their 366ï¿½ theory, the authors show that Thornborough sits at exactly 1/10th of the planets circumference from the pole, and remarkably, that the three Henges are separated from each other by 360 MR and 366 MR.  It has been   suggested that the three Henges at Thornborough were constructed   so as to imitate the three stars of Orion's belt.(4)Should this be   the case, then one has to question if other triple circles/Henges   in Britain may have also been constructed for the same purpose.  Then,   around 3000 BC, when the three Henges at Thornborough were   constructed, they appear to have been deliberately laid out to   mirror Orionï¿½s Belt. Not only this, but their southern entrances   framed the rising of the bright star, Sirius, which in turn meant   their axis aligned on the midwinter solstice. In an article   by Dr Harding, he explained: ï¿½Thornborough was a sacred landscape,   a place of religious worship, and we should try to interpret these   astronomical orientations within that context. ï¿½This   astronomical association was emphasised by the banks of the Henges   being coated in brilliant white gypsum. Neolithic people surely   felt they were at the centre of the very cosmos as they worshipped   the heavens above.ï¿½ Professor Clive   Ruggles, author ofAstronomy in Prehistoric Britain and   Ireland, was not so convinced by the Orion's belt layout of   the Henges. In 2003,   following a television documentary on Thornborough, he wrote on   hiswebsite: ï¿½The idea that the configuration of the Henges   themselves formed a spatial representation of the three stars is   something that I view with considerable scepticism.ï¿½ He did,   however, concede that it is plausible that the rising of the   stars, in relation to the local landscape, may have been   significant. He said: ï¿½ The 'Hurlers' triple stone circles in England have also been observed to have been laid so as to be aligned to mirror Orion's belt which would have risen through the southern circle on the winter solstice at the time it was built c. 1500 BC. They lie on the Eastern end of theSt. Michael's Leyline.   All three of the Thornborough Henges have two entrances which are aligned, like the Henge alignment itself, roughly NW-SE, which again is typical, and were laid out at approximately equal intervals along an alignment about 1.6 km (1 mile) in length. The mighty   'Tarmac' organisation have highlighted the importance of the   Thornborough complex again recently through their plans to   continue excavating the periphery of this site. Considering the   value of the site, as confirmed by the statement from English   Heritage that Thornborough is 'The most important site between   the Orkneys and Stonehenge', ones imagination boggles at the   fact that contractors have been once again given the go-ahead to   continue quarrying. What seems to be   eluding the organisers of this project is that the three henges   are not in isolation here. On the contrary, they are the centre of   an important sacred landscape, which was used for over a thousand   years. The result of quarrying the surrounding area is the   wholesale destruction of parts of this landscape, which will be   irreversibly lost to future (and perhaps wiser), generations.

"Tiahuanaco, Bolivia",Pyramid Complex,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/Boliviatiahuanaco.htm,"Tiahuanaco, Bolivia","Tiahuanaco sits in the Bolivian Andes at a height of over 12,500 ft. It was once one of the most significant complexes in the pre Columbian Americas. Inca tradition spoke of the founding Inca male and female coming toCuzcofrom the 'Island of the Sun' on LakeTiticaca, nearby. When the Spanish first encountered Tiahuanaco in the sixteenth century, they went to great efforts to destroy it. Early in the 20th century, Bolivian railway workers broke up many of the blocks as ballast for the railway beds. The remains of the site are now finally being restored. Tiahuanaco sits high in the Andes at an altitude of around 2 miles above sea level. The location is curious as a lake nearby to lake Titicaca, with which the site is associated, is asea-waterlake, apparently with sea-fauna still present. Indications of man-made structures below the level of lake Titicaca (which is slowly drying up over time), suggests that our understanding of the site is far from complete. In addition, the style, size and skill demonstrated by the vast number of precision-cut cyclopean stones at Tiahuanaco (and nearby Puma-punka) reminds us that cutting and moving 100+ ton stones was common-place for the highly skilled builders of the complex, who also managed to move the stones over tens of miles from distant quarries to Tiahuanaco, which at such a high altitude is in itself, a remarkable physical feat. Carbon-14 Dating puts the first period of Tiahuanaco back to 1,700 BC, the second period to 360 BC, and the third era from 133-374 AD to 1,200 AD The city was the administrative and   religious heart of a pre-Incan civilisation that began in the year   237 BC and endured for over 1400 years. During its peak (724- 1172   AD) the Tiahuanacan Empire covered nearly all of Bolivia, Northern Chile and Southern Peru, ruling over more than three million subjects. The Akapana pyramid was once a   seven-step pyramid measuring some 200 meters on each side and   standing nearly 17 meters tall. Like the nearby Subterranean   Temple and the Kalasasaya, the Akapana was precisely oriented to   the cardinal directions. Each of the seven levels was constructed   with beautifully cut and precisely joined andesite blocks (of   which 90% are now missing), that were faced with panels once   covered with metal plaques, carvings, and paintings. In the centre   of the Akapanaï¿½s flat summit is a small, sunken courtyard laid out   in the form of a square superimposed over a perfect cross; this   courtyard was also oriented to the cardinal directions. Recent   excavations of this courtyard, the interior of the pyramid, and   the grounds beneath it have revealed an unexpectedly sophisticated,   and monumental system of interlinked surface and subterranean   channels. These channels brought water collected upon the summit   down and through the seven levels, where it exited below ground   level, merged into a major subterranean drain system underneath   the civic/ceremonial core of Tiwanaku, and ultimately flowed into Lake Titicaca   The walls of the Kalasasaya are built in the same style as the semi-submerged temple, which opens out before it. Unlike the semi-submerged temple, the Kalasasaya is a semi-raised edifice, with the space inside the walls being filled in. As part of Posnansky`s studies, he conducted precise surveys of all the principal structures of Tiahuanaco. The Kalasasaya structure,  was delineated by a series of vertical stone pillars (the name Kalasasaya means ""the standing pillars"") and had an east-west orientation. Utilizing his measurements of the lines of sight along these stone pillars, the orientation of the Kalasasaya, and the purposely intended deviations from the cardinal points, Posnansky was able to show that the alignment of the structure was based upon an astronomical principle called the obliquity of the ecliptic.    The largest Stelae at Tiahuanaco (Right) is 7.3m high (20 ton), Bennett monolith, or 'Pachamama', which stood for several years in front of Le Paz stadium was taken in 1932 and returned 2002. The lower half of its body, which is covered with fish-scales (which upon close inspection are actually fish-heads), immediately reminds one of the Mesopotamian deity called Oannes, the man-fish amphibious being who conveyed special knowledge to ancient mankind.  The Subterranean Temple, was studded with sculptured stone heads set into cut-stone facing walls and in the middle of the court was located a now-famous monolithic 'Bennett' stela, Named for archaeologist Wendell C. Bennett who conducted the first archaeological research at Tiahuanaco in the 1930's, the Bennett Stela represents a human figure wearing elaborate clothes and a crown.  Roughly fifteen miles from Tiahuanaco, this lake is believed to have once extended to the city. The highest navigable water in the world. Its present fauna (including a species of sea horse),  a nearby salt-water lake, and the angle of an ancient shore-line have led scientists to consider that the lake may have once been attached to the sea, following which it was raised to its present height. On the rock cliffs near the piers and wharfs of the port area are yellow-white calcareous deposits forming long, straight lines indicating pre-historic water levels. These ancient shorelines are strangely tilted, although once they must have been level.Athough the lake averages between 460 and 600 feet (140 and 180 m) in depth, but the bottom tilts sharply toward the Bolivian shore, reaching its greatest recorded depth of 920 feet (280 m) off Isla Soto in the lake's northeast corner. On Titicaca Island the ruins of a temple   mark the spot where, according to the tradition of the Incas the   founders of the Inca dynasty, Manco Capac and Mama Ocllo,   depending on which variation one hears, were either sent down to   Earth by the Sun or emerged from the depths to found their empire.  Discoveries in the Lake.In November 1980,  the Bolivian authorand scholar of pre-Columbian cultures, Hugo Boero Rojo, announced the finding of archaeological ruins beneath Lake Titicaca about 15 to 20 metersbelow the surface off the coast of Puerto Acosta, a Bolivian port villagenear the Peruvian frontier on the northeast edge of the lake.At a press conference the Bolivian author stated that: ""we can now saythat the existence of pre-Columbian constructions under the waters of LakeTiticaca is no longer a mere supposition or science-fiction, but a real fact.

"Tierradentro, Colombia",Pre-Columbian Hypogea,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/columbiatierradentro.htm,"Tierradentro, Colombia","The typical hypogeum has an entry oriented towards the west, a spiral staircase and a main chamber, usually 5-8m below the surface, with several lesser chambers around, each one containing a corpse. The walls are painted with geometric, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic patterns in red, black and white. Some statues and remains of pottery and fabrics can be seen, but are scarce due to grave robbery before the hypogea were constituted as protected areas. The area was once home to a pre-Columbian culture which, for want of a better term is called the San Agustin culture as similar pottery and art have been found at both sites (1). Well over 50 tombs that have been discovered in the area, all underground and originally filled in with earth. most of which are accessible now; the government has excavated them and poured cement around the original stairwells that lead down into the tombs to protect them from erosion or other damage.

"Tres Zapotes, Mexico",Olmec Capital,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/mexicotreszapotes.htm,"Tres Zapotes, Mexico","Located on the slopes of the Tuxtla mountains, this is one of the most important Olmec cities, and the first to be written about in 1868, along with the first reports of colossal heads. Tres Zapotes is sometimes referred to as the third Olmec Capital, as it followed on the demise of both La Venta and San Lorenzo. Founded c. 1500 BC, it is believed that Tres Zapotes achieved prominence during the Early Formative period, between 1200 and 900 BC. During the Late Formative, 400 BC to 100 AD, when other Olmec centres such as La Venta were already in decline, Tres Zapotes sculptures showed the influence of other artistic styles, such as that of Izapa in the Guatemalan Highlands, and other regional styles(2).This indicates ongoing trade connections with other cultures, which would have influenced Tres Zapotes. Despite the fact that the Olmec culture may have no longer existed as such, Tres Zapotes continued to be occupied until well into the Early Postclassic (1000-1200 AD). There have been several important discoveries at Tres Zapotes, not least of all, the first discovery of a monumental Stone head, which have since inspired much debate over the origin and influence of Olmec cultural connections.  It was near Tres Zapotes that the first colossal head was discovered in 1862 by Josï¿½ Melgar. To date, only two 'monumental' heads have been found locally, labelled ""Monument A"" and Monument Q"". Smaller than the colossal heads atSan Lorenzo, they measure slightly less than 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) high. Together with the cruder and significantly larger head at Rancho la Cobata, these colossal heads show evidence of a specific style of dress and sculpture, differing from that of San Lorenzo and La Venta. Scarcely 10 km (6 mi) to the east stands Cerro el Vigï¿½a, an extinct volcano and important source of basalt and other volcanic stone, sandstone, and clay. The nearby small site of Rancho la Cobata, on the northern flank of Cerro El Vigï¿½a, may have functioned as a monument workshop ï¿½ most of the basalt stonework at Tres Zapotes was crafted from the colossal, ""spheroid"", smooth-faced boulders found even today at the summit of Cerro El Vigï¿½a. Some of these boulders are more than 3 meters in diameter. ""...The head was a head only, carved from a single massive block of basalt, and it rested on a prepared foundation of un-worked slabs of stone ... Cleared of the surrounding earth it presented an awe-inspiring spectacle. Despite its great size the workmanship is delicate and sure, the proportions perfect. Unique in character among aboriginal American sculptures, it is remarkable for its realistic treatment. The features are bold and amazingly Negroid in character...""(3) Image (Right): The rear of Monument Q showing Ethiopian style braided hair. This monument in particular offers one of the strongest arguments in favour of the heads representing people of African origin. Tres Zapotes Stela C:Tres Zapotes is famous for Stela C, a rectangular stone block with a post-Olmec Izapa-style mask on one side, and a Long Count date expressed in bars and dots on the other (below). The date, 7.16.6.16.18 6 Eznab (31 B.C.), was at the time, the Mesoamerica's oldest 'Mayan' Long Count inscriptions. What was shocking about this was that Tres Zapotes was not a Maya siteï¿½not in any way at all. It was entirely, exclusively, unambiguouslyOlmec. This suggested that the Olmecs, not the Maya, must have been the inventors of the calendar, and that the Olmecs, not the Maya, ought to be recognized as ï¿½the mother cultureï¿½ of Central America.  This very important fact has revealed several interesting aspects of Olmec culture. The Olmecs were much, much older than the Maya. Theyï¿½d been a smart, civilized, technologically advanced people and indeed, it appears that it was they, and not the Maya, who invented the bar-and-dot system of calendrical notation, including the enigmatic starting date of 13 August 3114 BC.    Tres Zapotes Stela D:This monument shows the open mouth of an animal, possibly representing the Earth Monster. Three human figures are carved in low relief in the back of the mouth. In 1939 Stirling described the style of this stela as ï¿½quite suggestive of Mayan art.ï¿½ This was, however, before the style was recognized as preceding the Maya and before the name Olmec was applied to the style and to the civilization that produced it.    Soon afterwards the American archaeologist made a second unsettling discovery at Tres Zapotes was also the place where archaeologists unearthed the first example of a Pre-Columbian wheeled object. Since then several more have been found in both Olmec and Mayan locations dispelling the myth that the wheel was unknown before the conquest. This particularly significant discovery is of the head of a man, with pointed beard, earplugs and headdress, from one of the mounds near Tres Zapotes. There are several other bearded figures in Olmec art, again placing an emphasis on the idea that the Olmecs were a multi-cultural society with influences from different cultures from the both Pacific and Atlantic..

In the 11th century, Toltecs who emigrated from Tula are believed to have settled on the site of the former Mayan city ofChichï¿½n Itzï¿½on the Yucatï¿½n peninsula, where they put up buildings in the Tula style. The ruins at Tula share many architectural, artistic and religious influences with the Maya city ofChichï¿½n Itzï¿½, some 700 miles away (by land) on Mexico's Yucatï¿½n peninsula. For years, scholars believed that the warlike Toltec had invaded distantChichï¿½n Itzï¿½and imposed their own culture. Today, however, most archaeologists believe that Toltec Tollï¿½n was one of many cities with whom the advanced Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½ traded and the common influences flowed from Chichï¿½n Itzï¿½ to Tollï¿½n. Whichever the direction of the cultural flow, there are several distinct similarities between the two cities. The major structure that remains today from the ruins of Tollï¿½n is the Temple of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli (Lord of the House of the Morning Star) ï¿½ referred to today at the site with more mundane (and more pronounceable) name of ""Pyramid B."" At the top of this pyramid stand four colossal statues, more than 15 feet tall, dressed as warriors. They may represent the Toltec ruler Ce Acatl Quetzalcï¿½atl (who was named after the fair-skinned god worshiped by many Mesoamerica cultures). These four figures wear stylized butterfly breastplates, sun-shaped shields on their backs, feathered headdresses and carry spear throwers and a supply of spears. They once served as pillars to support the roof of a temple that stood atop the pyramid. Along the base of the pyramid (on the side opposite the stairs) many Toltec carvings of jaguars, eagles and human skulls are still visible. At the foot of the stairs is an L-shaped colonnade that once supported a roof that may have provided a shaded passageway for the priests and nobility from the main pyramid toward the smaller Pyramid of the Sun (or ""Pyramid C"") to the east. Little remains today of Pyramid C. To the west of the main pyramid is the Quemado Palace (also known as the ""Burnt Palace""), which today is little more than a foundation that once supported three large rooms and a forest of truncated pillars that once supported a roof. Tula's east-facing great warrior statues, are apparently representations not of Tezcatlipoca, but of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli, the Plumed Serpent in his guise as Morning Star.  The most interesting of the other buildings is perhaps Coatepantli, or the wall of the snakes, whose name comes from the reliefs on the north face of the pyramid, which shows snakes eating human beings. Near, in front of the Palacio Quemado (Burnt Palace), we find the Chacmool, an inclined statue of a priest on whose chest there is a bowl where they deposited the offerings to the gods. Bones of children are displayed in Tula, Mexico April 19, 2007. The grisly find of the buried bones of 24 pre-Hispanic Mexican children may be the first evidence that the ancient Toltec civilization sacrificed children, an archeologist studying the remains said on Monday. The bones, dating from 950 AD to 1150 AD and dug up at the Toltecs' former capital Tula, north of present day Mexico City, indicated the children had been decapitated in a group.

"Ur, Iraq","Sumerian Capital, Ziggurat of Ur",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/iraqur.htm,"Ur, Sumeria","Ur was the capital of the Sumerian   civilisation and once a great harbour city on the banks of the Euphrates   river, until it changed its course and the city became lost, so that   Wooley was forced to dig  vast hole over 40ft deep to uncover the   lowest levels of the city.. This city, which is mentioned several times in the Bible asUr of the Chaldees(referring to the Chaldeans, whom settled in the area about 900 BC) as the birthplace of Prophet Abraham ""Ibrahim Al-Khalil"" (pbuh), was one of the most important cities of the Sumerians in the 4th and the 1st half of the 3rd millennium BC. It was also considered as one of the most active and full of life cities in southern Mesopotamia during the following centuries. In former days it stood on the banks of the Euphrates, until the river changed its course. Evidence suggests that Ur had three classes of people. The richer, government officials, priests and soldiers, were at the top. The second level was for merchants, teachers, labourers, farmers and craft-makers. The bottom were for slaves captured in battle. Burials at Ur give insight into people's social standing. Kings and queens were buried with treasure as realised by Wooly's discovery of the 'Royal' burial site. Wealthy people were buried with less. Since irrigation gave Ur abundant crops, not everybody needed to work on farms. People learned other skills. Sir Leonard Wooly made a tablet that listed Ur's special workers. The chisel workers made sculptures, the gem cutters made gems, and the fuller stomped on woven wools to make them soft. The metal workers made weapons.(6)  'Baked bricks were used for the lowest courses of walls, for drains, where bitumen was employed to make them watertight, and for paved courtyards and other exposed architecture such as the facades of buildings; important buildings, such as the ziggurat at Ur, might be encased in baked bricks as a protection against the elements. The use of bitumen as a mortar, particularly in the construction of large structures such as city walls, also provided an effective protection against damp. courses of reed matting and layers of bitumen were interspersed between those of brick in the construction of ziggurats to counteract rising damp from the foundations, and weep-holes also assisted drainage and prevented damp decay. Bitumen was also employed as a water-proofing material for bathrooms and constructional timber such as doors. Brick walls were often plastered to protect them against the rain. Mud could ne used as a plaster but a stronger and more attractive plaster was made of gypsum or lime, made by burning limestone.'(7) Ur was an ancient   Sumerian city that was settled in the late sixth millennium,   during the Ubaid period until about 3000 B.C., the area of Ur was about 37 acres. During the Early Dynastic Period, Ur reached its maximum area of 124 acres and was one of the richest Sumerian cities because it was a harbour, and therefore trading, town on the Persian Gulf.(2) The earliest occupations at     Ur date to the Ubaid period of the late 6th millennium BC. By about 3000 BC, Ur covered a total area of 37 acres including early temple sites. Ur reached its maximum size of 54 acres during the Early Dynastic Period of the early 3rd millennium, when Ur was one of the most important capitals of the Sumerian civilization. Ur continued as a minor capital for Sumer and succeeding civilizations, but during the 4th century BC, the Euphrates changed course, and the site was abandoned.(3) 2,670 BC- The founder     of the First Dynasty of Ur was the conqueror and temple builder     Mesanepada , the earliest Mesopotamian ruler described in extant     contemporary documents. His son Aanepadda (reigned about 2650     BC) built the temple of the goddess Ninhursag, which was     excavated in modern times at Tell Al-Obeid, about 8 km north     east of the site of Ur. 2,340 BC- Ur was     captured  by King Sargon of Agade, and this era, called the     Akkadian period, marks an important step in the blending of     Sumerian and Semitic cultures. After this dynasty came a long     period of which practically nothing is known except that a 2nd     dynasty rose and fell. 2113 - 2095 BC- Ur-Nammu,     the first king of the 3rd Dynasty of Ur, who revived the empire     of Sumer and Akkad, won control of the outlet to the sea about     2100 BC and made Ur the wealthiest city in Mesopotamia. His     reign marked the beginning of the so-called renaissance of     Sumerian art and literature at Ur. The descendants of Ur-Nammu     continued in power for more than a century, or until shortly     before 2000 BC, when the Elamites captured Ibbi-Sin (reigned     2029-2004 BC), king of Ur, and destroyed the city.  Article:   ABS-CBN News: (13th May 2009) 'UR, Iraq - The US military on     Wednesday handed control of ancient Ur, the biblical birthplace     of Abraham, back to Iraqi authorities, who hope now to re-launch     it as a major tourism site. ""We officially announce the     taking over of Ziggurat of Ur from our friends the Americans,""     Talib Kamil al-Hassan, governor of Dhi Qar province, said at a     ceremony to mark the return of the site six years after the     American invasion. ""We are pleased with this     great success for the nation,"" he added while the Iraqi flag was     hoisted atop the temple. ""Abraham, peace be upon him,     was born here, the father of prophets and religions,"" he said. The site is renowned for its     well preserved stepped platform or ziggurat, which dates back to     the third millennium BC. It lies near the US air base     of Talila, outside the southern city of Nasiriyah, and has been     closed to the public since the US-led invasion of 2003 that     toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. Ur of the Chaldees was one of     the great urban centres of the Sumerian civilisation of southern     Iraq and remained an important city until its conquest by     Alexander the Great a few centuries before Christ. The city, which dates back to     6000 BC, lies on a former course of the Euphrates, one of the     two great rivers of Iraq, and is one of the country's oldest     sites. The Iraqi Ministry of Tourism     and Antiquities announced in early April that the ceremony would     pave the way for the rehabilitation of Ur and its reopening to     the public. ""The local government will     begin the renovation of the archaeological site in cooperation     with the Ministry of Tourism to be ready to receive tourists     from the region but also across Iraq,"" said Hassan. ""All Iraqis are proud of this     site and are eager to visit as soon as all the barbed wire has     been removed,"" he added. The Great Ziggurat of Ur was a temple of Nanna, the moon deity in Sumerian mythology, and has two stages constructed from brick: in the lower stage the bricks are joined together with bitumen, in the upper stage they are joined with mortar. The temple was built in 2,100 B.C. during the reign of Ur-Nammu and stands 70 feet (21 m) high). The city was firstexcavated in 1853 and 1854 by British consul J. E. Taylor, who uncovered the then sand-covered remains of the famed ziggurat of Ur which was dedicated to the moon god Nanna in Sumerian mythology and the Babylonian equivalent Sin in Babylonian mythology.  However, the excavation of the actual city did not happen until 1918 when the British Museum funded an excavation under the leadership of British archaeologists Reginald C. Thompson and H. R. H. Hall.  Though excavation ceased in 1919, it was restarted in 1922 in a joint expedition by the British Museum and the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley.  Ending in 1934, this last expedition was the one that provided the most information on this mighty city of over 200 000 residents at its peak. In addition to excavating the ziggurat completely, the expedition unearthed the entire temple area at Ur and parts of the residential and commercial quarters of the city. The most spectacular discovery was that of the Royal Cemetery, dating from about 2600BC and containing art treasures of gold, silver, bronze, and precious stones. The findings left little doubt that the deaths of the king and queen of Ur were followed by the voluntary death of their courtiers and personal attendants and of the court soldiers and musicians. Within the city itself were discovered thousands of cuneiform tablets comprising administrative and literary documents dating from about 2700 to the 4th century BC. The deepest levels of the city contained traces of a flood, alleged to be the deluge of Sumerian, Babylonian, and Hebrew legend.  Golden Ram in Bush. Ur. Royal Graveyard - c 2,500 BC. This is one of an almost identical pair discovered by Leonard Woolley in the 'Great Death Pit', one of the graves in the Royal Cemetery at Ur. The other is now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. It was named the 'Ram in a Thicket' by the excavator Leonard Woolley, who liked biblical allusions. In Genesis 22:13, God ordered Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac, but at the last moment 'Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son'.(4)  Archaeologists can use both the trade in seals themselves, as well as the distances between seals and the corresponding sealings, to trace long-distance trade networks. One such set of seals were manufactured around 1,900 B.C. on two important island trading cities in the Persian Gulf - Bahrein and Failaka. These seals were traded all over the Middle East, and have been found at diverse and distant locations such as Susa in Iran, Bactria in Afghanistan, Ur in Iraq, and Lothal on the west coast of India. By 1,750 B.C. Common Style seals are found in locations ranging from Spain, to Mycenaean Greece, to Marlik near the shores of the Caspian Sea. These seals were made from faience, a less expensive material, and used by smaller merchants. The first objects unearthed from Harappa andMohenjo-Darowere small stone seals inscribed with elegant depictions of animals, including unicorn-like figures, and marked with Indus script writing which still baffles scholars. These seals are dated back to 2,500 B. C. Source: North Park University, Chicago, Illinois.  Seal impressions have been found in the ancient city of Harrapan, in the Indus River valley (modern Pakistan), that had been made by seals found in Lagash in Sumeria (modern Iraq). From 3,600 B.C. in Sumer, and a little later in the Indus Valley, we can find seals made out of a rare high-quality stone, lapis lazuli. These stones could only have originated from rather distant and inaccessible mines in Afghanistan.

"Vinca, Serbia",Old Europe,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/serbiavinca.htm,The Vinca Culture (Old Europe),"In 1908, the largest prehistoric Neolithic settlement in Europe was discovered in the village of Vinca, just a few miles from the Serbian capital Belgrade, on the shores of the Danube. Vinca was excavated between 1918 and 1934 and was revealed as a civilisation in its own right. Indeed, as early as the 6th millennium BC, three millennia before Dynastic Egypt, the Vinca culture was already a fully fledged civilisation. A typical town consisted of houses with complex architectural layouts and several rooms, built of wood that was covered in mud. The houses sat along streets, thus making Vinca the first urban settlement in Europe, but being far older than the cities of Mesopotamia and Egypt. And the town of Vinca itself was just one of several metropolises, with others at Divostin, Potporanj, Selevac, Plocnik and Predionica. Archaeologists concluded that ï¿½in the 5th and early 4th millennia BC, just before its demise in east-central Europe, 'Old Europeans' had towns with a considerable concentration of population, temples several stories high, a sacred script, spacious houses of four or five rooms, professional ceramicists, weavers, copper and gold metallurgists, and other artisans producing a range of sophisticated goods. A flourishing network of trade routes existed that circulated items such as obsidian, shells, marble, copper, and salt over hundreds of kilometres.ï¿½ The Vinca culture flourished from 5,500(2)to 3,500 BC(4)on the territories of what is now Bosnia, Serbia, Romania and Macedonia. It got its name from the present-day village of Vinca, 10 km east of Belgrade on the Danube river, where over 150 Vinca settlements have been determined. There is no evidence of war or defences in the townships, and it appears that the Vinca were a peaceful society combining low-level agriculture with foraging and trade. They produced the first known European examples of a 'proto'-script and were the first people in the world known to smelt copper. They existed in a similar state for almost 2,000 years, following which they appear to have dispersed around the Mediterranean and Aegean. V Copper working had been in progress in nearby Anatolia (Turkey), for well over 1,000 years before it appeared in Europe(5). One of the most exciting finds for archaeologists therefore, was the discovery of a sophisticated metal workshop with a furnace and tools including a copper chisel and a two-headed hammer and axe. ""This might prove that the Copper Age started in Europe at least 500 years earlier than we thought,"". The Copper Age marks the first stage of humans' use of metal, with copper tools used alongside older stone implements. It is thought to have started around the 4th millennium BC in south-east Europe, and earlier in the Middle East. The discovery of a mine - Europe's oldest - at the nearby Mlava river suggested at the time that Vinca could be Europe's first metal culture, a theory now backed up by the Plocnik site. ""These latest findings show that the Vinca culture was from the very beginning a metallurgical culture,"" said archaeologist Dusan Sljivar of Serbia's National Museum. ""They knew how to find minerals, to transport them and melt them into tools."" The metal workshop in Plocnik was a room of some 25 square meters, with walls built out of wood coated with clay. The furnace, built on the outside of the room, featured earthen pipe-like air vents with hundreds of tiny holes in them and a prototype chimney to ensure air goes into the furnace to feed the fire and smoke comes out safely. He said the early metal workers very likely experimented with colourful minerals that caught their eye -- blue azurite, bright green malachite and red cuprite, all containing copper -- as evidenced by malachite traces found on the inside of a pot. TheTărtăria tablets(below) refers to a group of three tablets, discovered in 1961 by archaeologist Nicolae Vlassa at a Neolithic site in the village of Tărtăria (about 30 km (19 mi) from Alba Iulia), in Romania. Two of the tablets are rectangular and the third is round. They are all small, the round one being only 6 cm (2ï¿½ in) across, and two  - one round and one rectangular - have holes drilled through them. All three have symbols inscribed only on one face The tablets, dated to around 5,300 BC(2), bear incised symbols - the Vinča symbols - and have been the subject of considerable controversy among archaeologists, some of whom claim that the symbols represent the earliest known form of writing in the world. subsequent radiocarbon dating on the Tărtăria finds pushed the date of the tablets (and therefore of the whole Vinča culture) much further back, to as long ago as 5,500 BC, the time of the early Eridu phase of the Sumerian civilization in Mesopotamia. This finding has reversed our concept of the origin of writing, and it is now believed that the Sumerians inherited a Vinca tradition of 'magical' or 'meaningful' scripture, probably following the collapse of the Vinca homeland c. 3,500 BC.  'Ancient tablets found in South Bulgaria are written in the oldest European script found ever, German scientists say. The tablets, unearthed near the Southern town of Kardzhali, are nearly 7,000 years old, and bear the ancient script of the Cretan (Minoan) civilization, according to scientists from the University of Heidelberg, who examined the foundings. This is the Cretan writing, also known as Linear A script, which dates back to XV-XIV century B.C. The discovery proves the theory of the Bulgarian archaeologists that the script on the foundings is one of the oldest known to humankind, the archaeologist Nikolay Ovcharov announced Wednesday. Ovcharov, who is heading the archaeological expedition in the ancient Perperikon complex near Kardzhali, called the discovery ï¿½revolutionaryï¿½. It throws a completely different light on Bulgariaï¿½s history, he said in an interview for the National Television'.(3) Article:Old Linear and the Zodiac Signs. Richard. D. Flavin, 1998.  Recent excavations at sites across Europe's biggest prehistoric civilization, the Vinca culture, point to a great degree of sophistication and a taste for art and fashion, archaeologists say. ""According to the figurines we found, young women were beautifully dressed, like today's girls in short tops and mini skirts, and wore bracelets around their arms,"" said archaeologist Julka Kuzmanovic-Cvetkovic. The Vinca tribe who lived between 5,400 and 4,700 BC in the 120-hectare site at what is now Plocnik knew about trade, handcrafts, art and metallurgy. ""They pursued beauty and produced 60 different forms of wonderful pottery and figurines, not only to represent deities, but also out of pure enjoyment,"" said Kuzmanovic. The findings suggest an advanced division of labour and organization. Houses had stoves, there were special holes for trash, and the dead were buried in a tidy necropolis. People slept on woollen mats and fur, made clothes of wool, flax and leather and kept animals. What we have then is the record of a civilisation that flourished in Europe between 6,000 and 3,500 BC and which appears to have enjoyed a long period of uninterrupted and peaceful living.The 'Old European' Vinca pottery, artefacts and writing all show an immediately noticeable similarity to what was originally thought to be an earlierUbaidSumerian influence from the middle east. In addition, the Cycladian/Cretan cultures are suspected of having close close artistic and possibly religious connections with the Vinca. Both of these cultures appeared following the demise of the Old European Heartland, perhaps not so coincidentally, at the same time as several other important civilisations (Egyptian, Indus Valley, Western European, Maltese Etc) appeared in the prehistoric record. Several eminent archaeologists of the time (such as Childe, Hood, Vlassa, Maccay), were convinced that the Vinca had somehow been influenced or 'cradled into being' by the mistaken belief at the time that the Sumerians werethe'Mother race'. However, much to everyone surprise, more recent discoveries of earlier Vinca settlements have shown quite clearly that events must have occurred the other way round as the Old European settlements, along with writing, pottery, metallurgy and 'Ubaid' style art, date to a thousand years before the first Sumerian fingerprint, suggesting remarkably that it was actually a Western European culture that influenced Sumerian development. Other similarities with cultures that followed the Vinca's demise have been noted such as therise of the so-called Cycladic and Cretan cultures, where the new settlers arrived around 3,200 BC. withidentical motifs such as the snake, intertwined with the bird goddess motif, the bee and the butterfly, with the distinctive motif of the double axe, are found both in 'Old Europe' and Crete. But the best evidence is in the writing of Old Europe and the 'Linear A' script of Crete, which are to all intents and purposes identical.

A flourishing network of trade routes existed that circulated items such as obsidian, shells, marble, copper, and salt over hundreds of kilometres.ï¿½ The Vinca culture flourished from 5,500(2)to 3,500 BC(4)on the territories of what is now Bosnia, Serbia, Romania and Macedonia.
One of the most exciting finds for archaeologists therefore, was the discovery of a sophisticated metal workshop with a furnace and tools including a copper chisel and a two-headed hammer and axe.
""This might prove that the Copper Age started in Europe at least 500 years earlier than we thought,"".
The discovery of a mine - Europe's oldest - at the nearby Mlava river suggested at the time that Vinca could be Europe's first metal culture, a theory now backed up by the Plocnik site.
""These latest findings show that the Vinca culture was from the very beginning a metallurgical culture,"" said archaeologist Dusan Sljivar of Serbia's National Museum.
subsequent radiocarbon dating on the Tărtăria finds pushed the date of the tablets (and therefore of the whole Vinča culture) much further back, to as long ago as 5,500 BC, the time of the early Eridu phase of the Sumerian civilization in Mesopotamia.
The tablets, unearthed near the Southern town of Kardzhali, are nearly 7,000 years old, and bear the ancient script of the Cretan (Minoan) civilization, according to scientists from the University of Heidelberg, who examined the foundings.
This is the Cretan writing, also known as Linear A script, which dates back to XV-XIV century B.C. The discovery proves the theory of the Bulgarian archaeologists that the script on the foundings is one of the oldest known to humankind, the archaeologist Nikolay Ovcharov announced Wednesday.
Recent excavations at sites across Europe's biggest prehistoric civilization, the Vinca culture, point to a great degree of sophistication and a taste for art and fashion, archaeologists say.
What we have then is the record of a civilisation that flourished in Europe between 6,000 and 3,500 BC and which appears to have enjoyed a long period of uninterrupted and peaceful living.The 'Old European' Vinca pottery, artefacts and writing all show an immediately noticeable similarity to what was originally thought to be an earlierUbaidSumerian influence from the middle east.
Both of these cultures appeared following the demise of the Old European Heartland, perhaps not so coincidentally, at the same time as several other important civilisations (Egyptian, Indus Valley, Western European, Maltese Etc) appeared in the prehistoric record.
However, much to everyone surprise, more recent discoveries of earlier Vinca settlements have shown quite clearly that events must have occurred the other way round as the Old European settlements, along with writing, pottery, metallurgy and 'Ubaid' style art, date to a thousand years before the first Sumerian fingerprint, suggesting remarkably that it was actually a Western European culture that influenced Sumerian development.
But the best evidence is in the writing of Old Europe and the 'Linear A' script of Crete, which are to all intents and purposes identical.",Serbia,Europe
"Waulud's Bank, England","Henge, Source of Avon",http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/englandwauluds.htm,"Waulud's Bank, England","The site has generally been regarded as a Neolithic Henge-type enclosure(3)It lies less than a mile from the prehistoric Icknield Way as well as sitting on the St. Michael's Leyline. It is on the site  of five springs that form the source of the river Lea. It is reputed in legend to be the place where Lugh, the Celtic god drank from and which gave him his powers(2). Hence speculation on the origin of the name (i.e.Lugh-townorLea-town). The Waulud's Bank Henge lies on the western edge of the Marsh Farm Estate in Leagrave, Luton (near to Nev's place). As well as sitting alongside the prehistoric Icknield Way, and on the St. Michael's Ley, five springs issue from a basin ten feet deep and a hundred feet wide at the northern end of the enclosure and these springs form the River Lea(1) Archaeological excavations in 1954 and 1970/71 date the site to around 3,000 B.C. in the Neolithic period(2), although there was evidence of earlier Mesolithic hunter/fisher activity in the immediate area. Grooved ware pottery shards were recovered from the ditch fill and at ground level under the bank(3) The western side of the enclosure south of the Lea is now occupied by Marsh Farm, obliterating the ancient features. Interestingly, William Austin in his 1928History of Lutonrecords another bank outside the ditch at this point. The 'D' shape of the earthwork is almost identical to that of Marden in Wiltshire, both sites have a river forming one side, and each produced Neolithic grooved-ware pottery.  The enclosure consisted of a bank and external ditch of around 7 hectares with a chalk and gravel bank surrounding the source of the river Lea. No entrances have been identified, although in 1953 it was hypothesized that it may have been at the northern end where a track enters the site(1) The Council for British Archaeology's Group 9 Newsletter Number 2 (page 5) of 1972 has a short piece on a recent excavation of Waulud's Bank prior to construction of a dual carriageway. The article, again written by James Dyer, states: ""The 1971 excavation confirmed that the whole earthwork was Neolithic in date. Its ditch, 6 feet deep and 30 feet wide was flat-bottomed. The material excavated from it had been piled up to form a bank, the front of which was revetted with turves. There were no indications of retaining posts (though one hole was found in 1953). Sealed below the bank were pieces of Windmill Hill pottery, including a lug, other decorated Neolithic sherds, a selection of flint work (including a leaf-shaped arrowhead), and many domestic and wild animal bones"".(1) Most external features have been destroyed by medieval ploughing  a 19th century gravel quarry on the south, the building of the Marsh Farm Estate itself ( including dumping tons of chalk and top-soil along the eastern side during building construction in the 1970s)(2). Geophysical surveys in June 1970 and January 2009 failed to reveal any very positive indications of internal features. The bank still stands 2.6 m high in places and on the north side the excavated ditch was 9.2 m wide and 2.1 m deep. Finds included Neolithic pottery, animal bones and flint arrow heads (some of which are on display at Stockwood Heritage Centre, Luton Museum). The source of the River Lea is known as the 'Five-Springs' and lies in the north-west corner of Wauluds Bank. According to legend, the Celtic god 'Lug' or 'Lud' or 'Lyg', presided over the springs. 'Lug' is the Celtic god of light, and the name 'Lea' may be derived from this name. The town now known as Luton is named after this river which may mean the river of the god Lugus. 'Ton' is anAnglo-Saxon name for atown or large settlement. So thereforeLuton could mean 'the town on the river of Lugus', although this is open to speculation. TheEnglish Heritage record claims that Waulud may be a corruption of the name Wayland (the smith) who was aNorse god, also known as Wolund, Weyland, or Weland.

"Weris, Belgium",Megalithic Concentration,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/belgiumweris.htm,"Weris, Belgium","The area surrounding the village ofWï¿½ris has been found to contain a high concentration of megalithic monuments. It likely had a particular significance to the prehistoric inhabitants and builders of the monuments, many of which are composed of stones weighing several tons each. The area is host to a 5km long alignment, which is also the longest in Belgium. The main Dolmen in the area; the 'Northern Dolmen' sits at the junction of this alignment and another equinoxial alignment (E-W), from the nearby natural rock formation called the 'Pierre Haina' or 'Stone of the Ancients'. The natural inclination of the stone towards the east, its prominent high position and the traditions still associated with it today, suggest that this stone held an importance as far back as the Neolithic and may be the very reason for the building of so many monuments in the area. There are several legends associated with these stones. In particular is that thePierre Hainais a seal or 'plug' to the underworld, from which on certain nights, the devil would come out and fly around, eventually resting on the nearby stone called the 'Devils Bed', (Above, apparently partially carved). Tradition has it that he would sleep there until the first Rooster crowed in the morning, when he would return to the underworld, replacing the Stone of the Ancients as he went. When the menhirs and two dolmens are plotted on a topographic map, the monuments appear to form an alignment which, adding the site of a missing menhir, extends to 5,000 yards. However, running NNE-SW, this orientation fails to mark any rising or setting positions of either sun or moon, nor does it point to any significant horizon features.(1)but it does follow the natural contours of the landscape. The NNE-SW, this orientation fails to mark any significant astronomical orientation. However, the alignment does follow the natural contours of the landscape, being surrounded by the hills of the Fagne-Famenne valley region, which is marked by an abrupt depressions in the schist landscape.  The Tour Menhir:(Menhir de Heyd) To the north of the valley at the hamlet Tour, was resurrected in 1998.  First cited by Helen Danthine in 1947, this stone is said to lie close to the site of a spring. The Tour Menhir is the most remote and Northerly stone in the alignment and is 2.8 Km from any natural source of Pudding-stone. The Northern Dolmen:(Allee Couverte Norde) Near the village Wï¿½ris is the Northern Dolmen, an impressive ""gallery"" type tomb, 33 feet long, and dated to the first half of the third millennium.(3)It has a now-ruined anti-chamber and spirit hole, and is covered by a massive, broken capstone, estimated to weigh 30 tons and supported by stones of which two are rectangular blocks weigh some 18 and 20 tons each. From the ante-chamber extends the remains of a straight stone avenue with thirty stones on either side, shown on an etching by the artist Moreels, drawn in 1888, when the dolmen was first excavated, cracking the capstone in the process. During a subsequent excavation in 1906, the ante-chamber was incorrectly restored: it was floored with broken stones, which originally formed the capstone of the chamber. The orientation of the monument is a couple of degrees of the larger alignment. This dolmen sits at the junction of the main alignment and the equinoxial alignment from the 'Stone of the ancients', due east.   The Danthine Menhir:One of three stones from the 'Long-stone' field. The largest was discovered in 1947 by Prof Helen Danthine, who moved it 130m to have ot placed beside the road, and from which it earned its name 'The Danthine Menhir'. Measuring 12 feet tall, the top of the slab sloping at a 45 degree angle, it weighs about eight tons. Two other stones were recovered from the field in 1983, 50m from the Danthine Menhir which have now been reinstated in their original position behind the Weris Dolmen.    The Southern Dolmen:In the vicinity is the Southern Dolmen, a ""sunken gallery type"" tomb, approximately 23 feet long, it also features an incorrectly restored ante-chamber with 'spirit hole', which originally facilitated offerings to the ancestral spirits. The main axis of the chamber is 55ï¿½, indicating a mid-summer solstice orientation, when the solar rays illuminate the circular spirit hole. At this dolmen, which may originally have been similar to a chambered mound, amateurs dug up five more stones in recent years.  The Three Menhirs of Bouhaimont at Oppagne:Continuing towards the southwest, there is a setting of three menhirs at right angles to the ""alignment"", of which the tallest stone measures 8 ft tall. First reported in 1888 by L. Moreels, at one time, they were removed by the owner of a hotel at Hotton, who set them up in his garden. In 1906, he was persuaded to return the three megaliths close to their original setting at Oppagne. Sadly, during transport, one of the menhirs broke in two halves, following which these were cemented back together. All stones of this ""triad"" have pointed tops. They are made of pudding-stone, like the dolmens. The original location pits for the stones are said to be just 5m south of their current position.(4) The Quarry:To the south of Wï¿½ris village, with its 11th century church dedicated to St. Walburge, there is located on the flank of a hill what is presumed to be the prehistoric quarry for the pudding stones. Below the rock face is what has been interpreted as a ""ramp"" to facilitate the removal and transportation of the stones by the megalithic builders. This implies that for the construction of the Northern dolmen, the 30 ton capstone was hauled to its site for some two miles. Both the larger dolmens in the area (Northern and Southern) have small holes in their entrances. These 'spirit holes' or 'portals' are a common feature in Dolmens particularly in Northern Europe and Russia (Caucasia) where they are seen more frequently than not. The term spirit holes suggests that they were incorporated into the monuments to allow the spirit free access, however several examples of stone 'plugs' have been found which suggest that they would have been only opened at particular times.

The   oldest and longest long-barrow in Britain. The mound is 350 ft long (100m)  varies in width from 75 ft at the east end and 50 ft at the west end, where it terminates in a sepulchre approx 35 ft wide, 43 ft long and 8 ft high. The entrance was blocked by several large sarsen stones, one of which weighs 20 tons(9). These stones were transported over 20 miles and were repositioned in 1956.  The construction of West Kennet commenced about 3,650 BC(1), which is some   400 years before the first stage of Stonehenge. It was used for approximately 30 - 40 years and was then closed off,(1)although it was re-opened several times over the following thousand years. In the past the mound has   been damaged by indiscriminate digging, but scientific excavations in 1859   and 1955-56 found a total of 46 burials, ranging from babies to old   people. The latest excavations also revealed that the side chambers occur   inside an exact isosceles triangle, whose height is twice the length of   its base. It is thought that this tomb was in use for as long as 1,000   years and at the end of this period the passage and chamber were filled to   the roof by the Beaker people with earth and stones, among which were   found pieces of pottery, bone tools, and beads. The barrow has been dug into at various times over the centuries notably by a Dr. Toope who, during the late 17th Century, who used any bones he found as an ingredient in potions and medicines. Because of these earlier intrusions no acceptably accurate record of its original contents can now be made.  There are several reported stones with faces on them (nine in one report). In the south-west chamber is a megalith with three cup-depressions near the top. It was in this chamber in 1955-56 that Stuart Piggott found that three skulls had been arranged against the south wall in a row: the skulls of a child, a young woman, and an elderly woman, perhaps alluding to the three ages of woman. The passage is aligned to true east. A local legend tells how this tomb is visited on Midsummer Day by a ghostly priest and a large white hound.

The hamlet is also the centre of a large scale geometric figure called 'The Decagon', which is claimed to connect Megalithic sites across southern Britain (as identified by John Michell - R.I.P). The three ancient Celtic ï¿½perpetual choirsï¿½ that supported spiritual integrity of the country were said by Michell to be at Llantwit Major, Glastonbury Abbey and Stonehenge, which he determined were three vertices of a regular decagon of huge proportions. A fourth vertex exists at Goring-on Thames where a major pagan temple once stood at the junction of several important track-ways. The geometry between Whiteleaved Oak, Stonehenge, Glastonbury and Goring-on-Thames is certainly astonishing,  being accurate to within 3/1000th's of a part. Such accuracy in itself is worth consideration but when it involves the 'sacred heart' of England (Glastonbury), its best known ancient monument (Stonehenge)and the crossing place of two of the most important prehistoric track-ways at Goring (The Ridgeway.. leading south to Avebury and Stonehenge, and the Icknield Way), one is forced to take notice of Michell's work.

There is a well used hearth where fires are burnt late into the night (until very recently there were two hearths but these have wisely been consolidated to create one larger fireplace) and at the solstices gifts are left hanging from the sacred oaks sturdy branches. At the summer solstice the oak was left strewn with blossoms and flowers and decked with brightly coloured ribbons, feathers, pentagrams and other trinkets and crafts. Until recently there was even a makeshift ï¿½visitors bookï¿½ left in a sheltered hollow in the treesï¿½ trunk that was rapidly filled with signatures, poems and blessings, but this has since become damaged and been removed.

"Xarez, Portugal",Stone Quadrant,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portomonsaraz.htm,"Monsaraz, Portugal","There are several worthwhile megaliths surrounding the peak of Monsaraz; or 'Mont-Xarez', which dominates the otherwise flat landscape in every direction. Over 130 sites have been recorded in the surrounding countryside The Xerez (Xarez) menhir / Stone-circle (quadrangle):Originally 5 km south of Monsaraz, the reconstitution of theXarez stone-circle beside the Convento do Oradawas only possible after some research since the original monoliths had been spread apart by  agricultural works. Today we are greeted with around 50 medium-sized rounded stones in an approximate square formation, centred with a 4m+ high, 7-ton menhir. The site plaque states that:'The Whole group had been artificially put together in the 20th century, resulting from the collection and arrangement of small monoliths and manual grindstones around the great menhir, which is 4m high'. The   research by Dr. Pires Gonï¿½alves   in the 1970's concluded that the monument was probably erected   between 4,000 BC and 3,000 BC and that its original design had   been quadrangular, consisting of 55 menhirs between 1.2 - 1.5   metres high. The stones are described as being both phallic and   rounded as at Almendres. It took Gonï¿½alves until 1972 to complete   the reconstruction. The azimuth of 100ï¿½ between Almendres and Xarez cromeleques has also been tentatively suggested as having been related to the azimuth of the full spring moon(3). Of interest is the fact that the spectacularAnta Grande da Zambujeiroalso sits along the same proposed 50km 'alignment', although none of the sites are inter-visible. The same alignment continues eastwards towards Lisbon.  Da Silva and Calado proposed that: 'A very simple observation could have been realized in megalithic times, in which the azimuths of the rising Sun and of the rising Full Moon, after Midwinter, are getting closer until they cross-over, i.e. until the Full Moon is seen to rise South of the direction in which the Sun was observed to rise in the same day. We know that this occurs about the time of the Equinox, and this cross-over may be used to provide an alternative definition of the ""megalithic equinox"". (5) There are several prominent engravings stilljustvisible on the upper-half of the menhir including a 'sun' shaped symbol, several 'crook's', and 'serpentine-wavy' lines), familiar only in style to the engravings insideGavr'inispassage-mound in France, similarly dated at around 4,500 BC).  About 3km (2 miles) north of Monsaraz, is the tallest (5.6m/18ft), menhir in the region, and second only in size to theMenir Meada, nearCastelo de Videin all Iberia. The stone weighs around 8 tons and was beautifully shaped and erected to lead an apparently solitary life in the flatlands, with Monsaraz alone looming in the background. There is a slight depression along the top which has led to the common assumption that it was originally phallic by design.  The 'Roche das Namorados' is actually a natural granite outcrop. It is occasionally referred to as 'mushroom-shaped' or 'Uterus' shaped, but its shape varies depending on where one stands. The stone has several large 'dimples' or 'cup-marks' on it, a common feature on Neolithic remains, although there is no way of proving their origin or meaning.

Today we are greeted with around 50 medium-sized rounded stones in an approximate square formation, centred with a 4m+ high, 7-ton menhir.
The   research by Dr. Pires Gonï¿½alves   in the 1970's concluded that the monument was probably erected   between 4,000 BC and 3,000 BC and that its original design had   been quadrangular, consisting of 55 menhirs between 1.2 - 1.5   metres high.
Da Silva and Calado proposed that: 'A very simple observation could have been realized in megalithic times, in which the azimuths of the rising Sun and of the rising Full Moon, after Midwinter, are getting closer until they cross-over, i.e. until the Full Moon is seen to rise South of the direction in which the Sun was observed to rise in the same day.
The stone weighs around 8 tons and was beautifully shaped and erected to lead an apparently solitary life in the flatlands, with Monsaraz alone looming in the background.",Portugal,Europe
"Zambujeiro, Portugal",Passage Mound,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/portozambujeiro.htm,"Anta Grande do Zambujeiro, Portugal","The combination of such large stones inside such a large passage-mound,    being in an area of such high    concentration, makes this passage mound one of the most significant    megalithic sites in all Iberia.. Although the internal design of the passage and raised chamber conforms to the traditional shape of other passage mounds across western Europe, Zambujeiro is the only example where the internal walls have been fashioned from large upright stones. Elsewhere in Portugal, the same basic design has been used for the construction of numerous 'antas', although they were all apparently only covered over with half mounds, leaving the upper parts protruding with the appearance of a dolmen. There are several large stones lying around the site which look as though they were left in a state of semi-readiness. One of the most impressive discarded stones is the 'leaf' shaped stone in front of the monument on the right-hand side of the entrance (see below). This stone has the appearance of having been left half finished although it is also just as likely that we see it today as it was originally intended. On the left hand side of the entrance (see left) lies a large (1.5m x 2m), flat topped stone with a large, single cup-mark in the centre of it. The position of these two prominent stones on either side of the entrance gives the site a sense of ceremony, before even bearing witness to the eight  giants that form the walls of the inside chamber.    A little further to the left of the large cup-marked stone lies an even larger stone with numerous smaller cup-marks on its upper surface (suggesting, as with the other cup-marked stone, that they have always been in the positions we see them today).  The mound itself is 50m in diameter and around 7-8m high. It is composed of rubble packing-stones of varying sizes and has been severely excavated in the past. The round shape of the mound is easily defined, except at the front which has lost all vestige of any original appearance. If the two large stones to the left and right of the passage entry were originally outside the structure, then we can conclude that it was never  completely round at the front as they liewithinthe perimeter of the diameter.   The passage is composed of several stones on either side, which appear to have been shaped along their tops in readiness to receive other stones. There are no visible markings on any of the stones. The floor of the passage has a rock feature, which appears to have been intentionally carved, although it is possible that this too is still in its original form. The passage has a slight bend along its length, a feature discussed below. The chamber is huge and cathedral-like from inside, and would have been more spectacular with the capstone in place. It is composed of 8 mauled granite stones, all 6-8m in height (above ground), with the largest at the rear almost 4m wide. There is no sign of carvings on any of them (except modern graffiti), and they all lean inwards,  pressing against each other and sharing the load of the surrounding mound. A feature similar to many Portuguese passage mounds and dolmens. Cope(1)mentions that excavators found 'callis beads, decorated schist plaques, flint and stone tools, pottery and a stone-axe', with mention of any skeletons notoriously absent.. The cap-stone to the chamber is around a half metre thick and lies on the top of the mound, behind the main chamber. It is broken into several pieces, and in its original state would have weighed several tons. It has the appearance of having either been slid off or having almost made it into place, before being broken (struck by lightning?).  The passage has a slight curve along its length, a feature which is more easily discernable at Newgrange, where it was used to restrict the entry of sunlight to the inner chamber. There are two standing stones in the passage which may have been originally part of the support, but are suspiciously placed as if to control the entry of sunlight to the chamber. The whole mound faces 20ï¿½ off true East (a feature noticeable at the other two passage mounds (Anta de San Gens, andAnta do Tapadao) in the Alentejo, both of which also show the same gigantic stone work, although neither on the scale of Zambujeiro.

"Ziggurat of Ur, Iraq",Stepped Pyramid,http://www.ancient-wisdom.com/iraqur.htm,"Ur, Sumeria","Ur was the capital of the Sumerian   civilisation and once a great harbour city on the banks of the Euphrates   river, until it changed its course and the city became lost, so that   Wooley was forced to dig  vast hole over 40ft deep to uncover the   lowest levels of the city.. This city, which is mentioned several times in the Bible asUr of the Chaldees(referring to the Chaldeans, whom settled in the area about 900 BC) as the birthplace of Prophet Abraham ""Ibrahim Al-Khalil"" (pbuh), was one of the most important cities of the Sumerians in the 4th and the 1st half of the 3rd millennium BC. It was also considered as one of the most active and full of life cities in southern Mesopotamia during the following centuries. In former days it stood on the banks of the Euphrates, until the river changed its course. Evidence suggests that Ur had three classes of people. The richer, government officials, priests and soldiers, were at the top. The second level was for merchants, teachers, labourers, farmers and craft-makers. The bottom were for slaves captured in battle. Burials at Ur give insight into people's social standing. Kings and queens were buried with treasure as realised by Wooly's discovery of the 'Royal' burial site. Wealthy people were buried with less. Since irrigation gave Ur abundant crops, not everybody needed to work on farms. People learned other skills. Sir Leonard Wooly made a tablet that listed Ur's special workers. The chisel workers made sculptures, the gem cutters made gems, and the fuller stomped on woven wools to make them soft. The metal workers made weapons.(6)  'Baked bricks were used for the lowest courses of walls, for drains, where bitumen was employed to make them watertight, and for paved courtyards and other exposed architecture such as the facades of buildings; important buildings, such as the ziggurat at Ur, might be encased in baked bricks as a protection against the elements. The use of bitumen as a mortar, particularly in the construction of large structures such as city walls, also provided an effective protection against damp. courses of reed matting and layers of bitumen were interspersed between those of brick in the construction of ziggurats to counteract rising damp from the foundations, and weep-holes also assisted drainage and prevented damp decay. Bitumen was also employed as a water-proofing material for bathrooms and constructional timber such as doors. Brick walls were often plastered to protect them against the rain. Mud could ne used as a plaster but a stronger and more attractive plaster was made of gypsum or lime, made by burning limestone.'(7) Ur was an ancient   Sumerian city that was settled in the late sixth millennium,   during the Ubaid period until about 3000 B.C., the area of Ur was about 37 acres. During the Early Dynastic Period, Ur reached its maximum area of 124 acres and was one of the richest Sumerian cities because it was a harbour, and therefore trading, town on the Persian Gulf.(2) The earliest occupations at     Ur date to the Ubaid period of the late 6th millennium BC. By about 3000 BC, Ur covered a total area of 37 acres including early temple sites. Ur reached its maximum size of 54 acres during the Early Dynastic Period of the early 3rd millennium, when Ur was one of the most important capitals of the Sumerian civilization. Ur continued as a minor capital for Sumer and succeeding civilizations, but during the 4th century BC, the Euphrates changed course, and the site was abandoned.(3) 2,670 BC- The founder     of the First Dynasty of Ur was the conqueror and temple builder     Mesanepada , the earliest Mesopotamian ruler described in extant     contemporary documents. His son Aanepadda (reigned about 2650     BC) built the temple of the goddess Ninhursag, which was     excavated in modern times at Tell Al-Obeid, about 8 km north     east of the site of Ur. 2,340 BC- Ur was     captured  by King Sargon of Agade, and this era, called the     Akkadian period, marks an important step in the blending of     Sumerian and Semitic cultures. After this dynasty came a long     period of which practically nothing is known except that a 2nd     dynasty rose and fell. 2113 - 2095 BC- Ur-Nammu,     the first king of the 3rd Dynasty of Ur, who revived the empire     of Sumer and Akkad, won control of the outlet to the sea about     2100 BC and made Ur the wealthiest city in Mesopotamia. His     reign marked the beginning of the so-called renaissance of     Sumerian art and literature at Ur. The descendants of Ur-Nammu     continued in power for more than a century, or until shortly     before 2000 BC, when the Elamites captured Ibbi-Sin (reigned     2029-2004 BC), king of Ur, and destroyed the city.  Article:   ABS-CBN News: (13th May 2009) 'UR, Iraq - The US military on     Wednesday handed control of ancient Ur, the biblical birthplace     of Abraham, back to Iraqi authorities, who hope now to re-launch     it as a major tourism site. ""We officially announce the     taking over of Ziggurat of Ur from our friends the Americans,""     Talib Kamil al-Hassan, governor of Dhi Qar province, said at a     ceremony to mark the return of the site six years after the     American invasion. ""We are pleased with this     great success for the nation,"" he added while the Iraqi flag was     hoisted atop the temple. ""Abraham, peace be upon him,     was born here, the father of prophets and religions,"" he said. The site is renowned for its     well preserved stepped platform or ziggurat, which dates back to     the third millennium BC. It lies near the US air base     of Talila, outside the southern city of Nasiriyah, and has been     closed to the public since the US-led invasion of 2003 that     toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. Ur of the Chaldees was one of     the great urban centres of the Sumerian civilisation of southern     Iraq and remained an important city until its conquest by     Alexander the Great a few centuries before Christ. The city, which dates back to     6000 BC, lies on a former course of the Euphrates, one of the     two great rivers of Iraq, and is one of the country's oldest     sites. The Iraqi Ministry of Tourism     and Antiquities announced in early April that the ceremony would     pave the way for the rehabilitation of Ur and its reopening to     the public. ""The local government will     begin the renovation of the archaeological site in cooperation     with the Ministry of Tourism to be ready to receive tourists     from the region but also across Iraq,"" said Hassan. ""All Iraqis are proud of this     site and are eager to visit as soon as all the barbed wire has     been removed,"" he added. The Great Ziggurat of Ur was a temple of Nanna, the moon deity in Sumerian mythology, and has two stages constructed from brick: in the lower stage the bricks are joined together with bitumen, in the upper stage they are joined with mortar. The temple was built in 2,100 B.C. during the reign of Ur-Nammu and stands 70 feet (21 m) high). The city was firstexcavated in 1853 and 1854 by British consul J. E. Taylor, who uncovered the then sand-covered remains of the famed ziggurat of Ur which was dedicated to the moon god Nanna in Sumerian mythology and the Babylonian equivalent Sin in Babylonian mythology.  However, the excavation of the actual city did not happen until 1918 when the British Museum funded an excavation under the leadership of British archaeologists Reginald C. Thompson and H. R. H. Hall.  Though excavation ceased in 1919, it was restarted in 1922 in a joint expedition by the British Museum and the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania under the direction of British archaeologist Sir Leonard Woolley.  Ending in 1934, this last expedition was the one that provided the most information on this mighty city of over 200 000 residents at its peak. In addition to excavating the ziggurat completely, the expedition unearthed the entire temple area at Ur and parts of the residential and commercial quarters of the city. The most spectacular discovery was that of the Royal Cemetery, dating from about 2600BC and containing art treasures of gold, silver, bronze, and precious stones. The findings left little doubt that the deaths of the king and queen of Ur were followed by the voluntary death of their courtiers and personal attendants and of the court soldiers and musicians. Within the city itself were discovered thousands of cuneiform tablets comprising administrative and literary documents dating from about 2700 to the 4th century BC. The deepest levels of the city contained traces of a flood, alleged to be the deluge of Sumerian, Babylonian, and Hebrew legend.  Golden Ram in Bush. Ur. Royal Graveyard - c 2,500 BC. This is one of an almost identical pair discovered by Leonard Woolley in the 'Great Death Pit', one of the graves in the Royal Cemetery at Ur. The other is now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. It was named the 'Ram in a Thicket' by the excavator Leonard Woolley, who liked biblical allusions. In Genesis 22:13, God ordered Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac, but at the last moment 'Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son'.(4)  Archaeologists can use both the trade in seals themselves, as well as the distances between seals and the corresponding sealings, to trace long-distance trade networks. One such set of seals were manufactured around 1,900 B.C. on two important island trading cities in the Persian Gulf - Bahrein and Failaka. These seals were traded all over the Middle East, and have been found at diverse and distant locations such as Susa in Iran, Bactria in Afghanistan, Ur in Iraq, and Lothal on the west coast of India. By 1,750 B.C. Common Style seals are found in locations ranging from Spain, to Mycenaean Greece, to Marlik near the shores of the Caspian Sea. These seals were made from faience, a less expensive material, and used by smaller merchants. The first objects unearthed from Harappa andMohenjo-Darowere small stone seals inscribed with elegant depictions of animals, including unicorn-like figures, and marked with Indus script writing which still baffles scholars. These seals are dated back to 2,500 B. C. Source: North Park University, Chicago, Illinois.  Seal impressions have been found in the ancient city of Harrapan, in the Indus River valley (modern Pakistan), that had been made by seals found in Lagash in Sumeria (modern Iraq). From 3,600 B.C. in Sumer, and a little later in the Indus Valley, we can find seals made out of a rare high-quality stone, lapis lazuli. These stones could only have originated from rather distant and inaccessible mines in Afghanistan.
